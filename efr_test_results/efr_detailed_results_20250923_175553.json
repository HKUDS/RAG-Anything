It employs various LLM agents to process and extract meaningful information from chart images, ensuring the responses generated are accurate and grounded in evidence.\n\n#### Workflow and Agent Roles\n\n1. **Chart-to-Table Extraction Agent**: This agent initiates the process by converting chart images found in PDFs or scanned documents into structured HTML tables. This step is crucial as it transforms visual data into a format that can be easily manipulated for analysis. Techniques such as few-shot prompting are used to ensure accuracy in data extraction [DC 2502.00989v1.pdf].\n\n2. **Entity Captioning Agent**: This component expands the HTML tables into detailed row, column, and cell captions, providing a richer contextual description of the data. It uses GPT-4o to help interpret complex table structures, a critical step for generating comprehensive and accurate citations [KG ChartCitor - Entity Captioning Agent].\n\n3. **LLM Pre-filtering Agent**: This agent filters out irrelevant data by scoring the relevance of table rows and columns, thus optimizing the amount of data the system processes further. It employs reasoning techniques to avoid the pitfalls of misleading information, offering a more streamlined data set for further analysis [KG LLM Pre-filtering Agent - LLM Re-ranking Agent].\n\n4. **LLM Re-Ranking Agent**: Following pre-filtering, this agent re-ranks the remaining data, ensuring that the selected table cells directly support the claims being made. Such a re-ranking process is key in maintaining trust in the generated answers by aligning claims more closely with cited data [KG LLM Re-ranking Agent].\n\n5. **Cell Localization Agent**: The final step involves mapping table cells back to visual elements in the chart. This agent uses DETR to generate accurate bounding box coordinates, further enhancing reliability. By correlating table-derived information with its visual counterparts, the system provides clear and trustworthy answers [KG Cell Localization Agent].\n\n#### Performance and Results\n\nChartCitor has proven to be highly effective compared to other models in visual chart comprehension and citation accuracy. It outperforms others like Kosmos-2 and LISA, as indicated by its superior IoU score of 27.4, reflecting its robustness in mapping visual data accurately [DC 2502.00989v1.pdf].\n\n### References\n\n- [KG] ChartCitor - Entity Captioning Agent\n- [KG] LLM Pre-filtering Agent - LLM Re-ranking Agent\n- [KG] Cell Localization Agent\n- [DC] 2502.00989v1.pdf"

Its primary function is to orchestrate various large language model (LLM) agents to extract, verify, and cite information from chart images effectively.\n\n#### Key Components and Workflow\n\n1. **Table Extraction Agent**: This component processes chart images, mainly from PDFs or scanned documents, and converts them into structured formats like HTML tables using few-shot examples. The extraction process includes checking for consistency between extracted data and the original chart to ensure accuracy. This involves the LLM evaluating its own output, thereby refining and reducing errors before finalizing the data table [DC 2502.00989v1.pdf].\n\n2. **Entity Captioning Agent**: This agent generates detailed descriptions for rows, columns, and individual cells within the extracted table. It leverages LLMs to overcome challenges like ambiguous content and domain-specific terminologies, thereby enabling more reliable evidence extraction for subsequent citation validation [DC 2502.00989v1.pdf].\n\n3. **LLM Prefiltering Agent**: This function hypothesizes that certain table elements may not contribute to answer facts. It assigns relevance scores to rows and columns, filtering out less pertinent data to refine the re-ranking process. This selective approach ensures that only the most relevant information reaches the LLM re-ranker, enhancing the robustness of citation retrieval [DC 2502.00989v1.pdf].\n\n4. **LLM Re-Ranking Agent**: After pre-filtering, this agent re-ranks the selected table cells to identify those that directly support the answer claims. It uses models like RankGPT to ensure logical coherence in evidence retrieval, minimizing the possibility of inaccuracies or \"hallucinations\" in citation generation [KG ChartCitor - RankGPT].\n\n5. **Cell Localization Agent**: This agent maps the cited table cells to corresponding visual elements within the chart image, such as bars, lines, or pie slices. Utilizing DETR and few-shot prompting, it accurately identifies and places bounding box coordinates on relevant visual elements, enhancing the integrity and trustworthiness of the chart-based answers [DC 2502.00989v1.pdf].\n\n#### System Performance and Evaluation\n\nChartCitor significantly outperforms other methods in visual grounding tasks, as evidenced by its higher Intersection over Union (IoU) scores compared to models like Kosmos-2 and LISA. Its comprehensive multi-agent system enables more accurate and explainable citation generation, which has been positively received in user studies comparing its performance to other LLM tools such as GPT-4o [DC 2502.00989v1.pdf].\n\n### References\n\n- [KG] ChartCitor\n- [KG] ChartCitor - RankGPT\n- [DC] 2502.00989v1.pdf"
