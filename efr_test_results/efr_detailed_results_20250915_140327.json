          "response": "### Main Contribution\n\nThe paper presents **ChartCitor**, a novel multi-agent framework designed to improve visual chart understanding, particularly in chart question-answering (QA) tasks with large language models (LLMs). A key contribution of ChartCitor is its ability to provide fine-grained bounding box citations that ground LLM-generated responses in chart images, thereby enhancing the accuracy and trustworthiness of AI-generated answers. This is accomplished by orchestrating various specialized LLM agents to perform tasks such as chart-to-table extraction, answer reformulation, evidence retrieval, and visual data localization [DC 2502.00989v1.pdf].\n\n### System Workflow\n\nChartCitor's workflow involves multiple components, including a Table Extraction Agent, which converts charts into structured table formats, and an Entity Captioning Agent, which generates contextual descriptions for table elements. The Answer Reformulation Agent facilitates more accurate citations by breaking down responses into logical steps. ChartCitor also employs pre-filtering and re-ranking agents to refine cell retrieval based on relevance scores, ensuring precise citation matching. This process culminates in the Cell Localization Agent, which pinpoints visual elements in chart images [DC 2502.00989v1.pdf; DC 2502.00989v1.pdf].\n\n### Evaluation and Results\n\nEmpirical evaluations demonstrate that ChartCitor significantly outperforms existing models like LISA and Kosmos-2 in visual grounding tasks, achieving a high Intersection over Union (IoU) score of 27.4, which indicates its robustness in mapping visual elements to factual assertions. User studies further validate ChartCitor's effectiveness, with participants rating its citations as more accurate than those produced by GPT-4o [DC 2502.00989v1.pdf; KG ChartCitor - Performance Comparison of Chart Interpretation Methods (table)].\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOverall, ChartCitor represents a substantial advancement in chart QA by integrating multiple LLM agents for enhanced accuracy and reliability of AI-generated responses. Future work could focus on multi-chart interactions and improving multimodal content generation [DC 2502.00989v1.pdf].\n\n### References\n\n- [DC] 2502.00989v1.pdf\n- [KG] ChartCitor - Performance Comparison of Chart Interpretation Methods (table)"

          "response": "### Main Contribution\n\nThe primary contribution of this paper is the introduction of **ChartCitor**, a comprehensive multi-agent framework designed to enhance accuracy in chart question-answering tasks through fine-grained bounding box citations. ChartCitor addresses key challenges faced by Large Language Models (LLMs) in generating accurate responses from chart data, such as hallucinations and the difficulty of mapping visual elements to source charts. By orchestrating multiple LLM agents, ChartCitor effectively extracts structured data from charts, reformulates answers, augments tables, retrieves evidence, and aligns answers with chart elements, leading to more reliable and explained citations.\n\n### Framework and Evaluation\n\nChartCitor leverages several components like the Chart2Table Extraction Agent for translating charts into structured formats, the Answer Reformulation Agent for decomposing answers into logical steps, and the Entity Captioning Agent for generating comprehensive descriptions. Furthermore, a user study demonstrated ChartCitor's superior performance and utility compared to direct GPT-4o prompting, with users rating its attributions as more accurate and useful for verifying chart-based queries [DC 2502.00989v1.pdf].\n\n### Performance Advantage\n\nThe framework significantly outperforms existing models, achieving an Intersection over Union (IoU) score of 27.4, which is higher than baseline models like Kosmos-2 and LISA. This empirical evidence highlights ChartCitor's robustness in visual grounding tasks, marking a substantial stride in multimodal AI understanding and citation accuracy [DC 2502.00989v1.pdf].\n\n### Conclusion\n\nChartCitor is presented as a promising solution for grounding LLM-generated responses in chart QA tasks, enhancing user trust and professional productivity by reducing hallucinations and improving explainability. While it currently excels in single-chart citations, opportunities exist for future work addressing more complex interactions across multiple charts and stronger citation-text mapping [DC 2502.00989v1.pdf].\n\n### References\n\n- [DC] 2502.00989v1.pdf\n- [KG] ChartCitor - User Study\n- [KG] ChartCitor - Performance Comparison of Chart Interpretation Methods (table)"

This framework employs multiple specialized Language Model (LLM) agents to ensure accurate information extraction and citation from chart images. Here's a detailed look at how this framework operates:\n\n## Workflow Components\n\n1. **Table Extraction Agent**: This is the initial stage, where the framework processes an input chart and converts it into an HTML table format using few-shot examples. This step sets the groundwork for further data extraction by providing a structured representation of the chart data [DC] 2502.00989v1.pdf.\n\n2. **Entity Captioning Agent**: Once the HTML table is prepared, this agent generates detailed descriptions for rows, columns, and cells. These captions provide context and enhance the semantic understanding of the table contents, thereby improving linkages between chart visuals and associated data [DC] 2502.00989v1.pdf.\n\n3. **LLM Prefiltering Agent**: It hypothesizes about the relevance of table rows and columns to the answer facts. This agent employs chain-of-thought and plan-and-solve prompting to generate relevance scores, which help in filtering out irrelevant data before re-ranking [DC] 2502.00989v1.pdf. \n\n4. **LLM Re-Ranking Agent**: Using RankGPT, this agent re-evaluates the filtered data to select the most relevant table cells that directly support answer claims. This step minimizes misinformation, improving citation accuracy [KG] LLM Re-ranking Agent - RankGPT.\n\n5. **Cell Localization Agent**: The final step involves mapping the previously cited table cells to their corresponding visual elements in the chart image. This is achieved by generating bounding box coordinates to accurately localize these elements, ensuring a precise match between visual data and cited claims [DC] 2502.00989v1.pdf.\n\n## Outcome and Evaluation\n\nChartCitor's multi-agent framework is evaluated using various metrics like the Intersection over Union (IoU), where it outperforms other models such as GPT-4V and LISA in visual grounding tasks, achieving a higher IoU score [DC] 2502.00989v1.pdf.

It utilizes few-shot prompting with GPT-4V to achieve consistent re-plotted outputs, ensuring the extracted tables accurately reflect the original chart elements [DC] 2502.00989v1.pdf.\n\n2. **Entity Captioning Agent**: This agent expands the structured tables into detailed contextual descriptions at the row, column, and cell levels. It uses advanced techniques to generate rich semantic insights, which help in deciphering complex tabular data [DC] 2502.00989v1.pdf.\n\n3. **LLM Prefiltering Agent**: By establishing relevance scores for each table element, this agent filters out unrelated rows and columns before the re-ranking process. This step minimizes noise and ensures that only potentially relevant data is considered in the final decision-making process [KG] LLM Prefiltering Agent - Score Filter.\n\n4. **LLM Re-Ranking Agent**: Utilizing RankGPT, this agent refines the selection of table cells, ensuring that the citations directly support the claims made in the answers.
