ChartCitor achieves better performance compared to directly prompting LLMs to predict bounding boxes. Further, even \n\nusing GPT-4V with set of marks prompting over detected chart elements show weak performance. Kosmos-2 and LISA perform poorly, with very low IoU scores, highlighting their inability to handle factual grounding in charts due to insufficient visual and numerical reasoning. Interestingly, all tested method including our proposed ChartCitor, zero-shot LMM prompting, LISA and KOSMOS2 struggle with interpreting complex geometrical proportions in pie charts due to their difficulty in handling non-rectangular bounding box segmentation task. Further, we conducted a user study (Fig. 2(b) to evaluate the citation accuracy and perceived utility of fine-grained chart attribution provided by ChartCitor. Five participants evaluated 250 randomly sampled question-answer pairs with associated chart images to study the usefulness and accuracy of the citations provided by ChartCitor compared to direct GPT-4o prompting. The evaluation results demonstrated strong positive reception, with participants rating the attributions as Completely Accurate $4 1 \\%$ vs $2 8 \\%$ ) or Somewhat Accurate ( $1 7 \\%$ vs $1 5 \\%$ ) for verifying chart-based question answering accuracy in ChartCitor and GPT-4o, respectively. Attributions were found to be more \"Completely Inaccurate\" ChartCitor than GPT-4o ( $1 7 \\%$ vs $3 1 \\%$ ). Participants described the citations as a handy tool in making verification of LLM-generated answers easier (\"...can help me to quickly verify trends in charts, cutting down the time I spent on 10 documents from 5 hrs to 20 mins.\"). \n\n5 Conclusion \n\nWe introduced ChartCitor, which grounds LLM-generated QA responses to chart elements using agentic orchestration and set-ofmarks prompting. The system outperforms baselines by $9 . 1 5 \\%$ and shows promise for rich document QA over PDF collections. While currently effective for single-chart citations, future work can address multi-chart interactions, hallucination mitigation, and explicit citation-text mapping to enhance trustworthy multimodal content generation. \n\nReferences \n\n[1] Josh Achiam, Steven Adler, Sandhini Agarwal, Lama Ahmad, Ilge Akkaya, Florencia Leoni Aleman, Diogo Almeida, Janko Altenschmidt, Sam Altman, Shyamal Anadkat, et al. 2023.

Tables often present analytical challenges through ambiguous content, including technical terminology, contextless numeric values, domain-specific symbols, and hierarchical row/column headers. These ambiguities impede reliable evidence extraction and citation validation through semantic matching. Our solution leverages LLMs in an unsupervised manner to generate rich, multi-layered contextual descriptions: (i) Row Captioning: Our system employs GPT-4o to generate comprehensive row-level descriptions that capture complex patterns across features, summarize temporal trends, highlight significant dates and provide comparative analysis with respect to outliers within each row. (ii) Column Captioning: We generate detailed captions for each column using GPT-4o to explain ambiguous measurement units, symbols, empty cell spaces, and technical relationship of it’s contents with corresponding row headers. (iii) Cell Captioning: Row and column-level captions may highlight broader trends but the fine-grained cell level information needs to be contextualized in terms of its associated row and column headers. Captioning agent uses GPT-4o to describe the importance of each cell in the context of its associated row and columns. \n\nTable Cell Retrieval: We use retrieve-then-rank approach to identify the most relevant table cells. Our two-step approach begins with LLM-based pre-filtering to reject irrelevant rows and columns. We then employ LLM re-ranking to retrieve the most precise cell-level matches, ensuring both comprehensive coverage and accuracy in the final selection. \n\n(4) LLM Pre-filtering Agent: We hypothesize that some of the table rows/ columns are likely to be unrelated to the answer facts. Passing irrelevant and distracting table entities to the LLM-based re-ranker can mislead it, negatively impacting the ranking process. Inspired by [11], the LLM-based pre-filtering step uses chain-of-thought [18] followed by Plan and Solve [17] prompting techniques to generate a relevance score for each row/column based on the significance of its descriptive caption to the given answer statement (between 0 to 1). Additionally, we prompt the LLM to explain its rationale behind the score generation to enhance explainability and avoid hallucinations. We establish a specific threshold (usually $0 . 3 - 0 . 5 )$ ) for row/column filtering to retain potential citations that are sent to the re-ranker, discarding those falling below the threshold. This implementation significantly reduces the number of noisy of rows and columns that can misguide the re-ranker, leading to an improved citation retrieval performance. \n\n(5) LLM Re-ranking Agent: LLMs providing citations that don’t directly support their claims can be interpreted as a form of hallucination which may diminish user confidence. To solve this, we retrieve the set of table cells that are collectively both sufficient and directly relevant to the answer claims. We use RankGPT [15], a listwise LLM re-ranker to re-rank the table cells extracted from the intersection of rows and columns selected in the pre-filtering stage. Additionally, we prompt GPT-4o to provide a layer-of-thought [3] explanation of its rationale in ranking the cell items, enhancing the transparency in the citation mechanism by enforcing a logical coherence in the evidence chain. \n\n(6) Cell Localization Agent: The final step maps cited table cells to their corresponding visual elements in the chart image. This agent leverages DETR trained [2] on ChartQA data to identify all possible data marks (bars, line segments, pie slices) using image processing algorithms. GPT-4V with few-shot set-of-marks prompting [20] then identifies elements corresponding to the cited cells. The agent generates bounding box coordinates for the relevant visual elements, employing visual self-reflection to verify precise correspondence between highlighted regions and cited data points. \n\n3 Implementation Details \n\nAll constituent agents utilize textual LLM APIs such as those provided by OpenAI (GPT-4o, GPT-4V) or Claude Sonnet-3.5. We use ChatGPT $- 4 0$ as the base multimodal language model (MLLM) for ChartCitor. We convert data tables from TabCite benchmark [10] into bar/pie/line charts along with paired QA. \n\nEvaluation: We adopt visual Intersection over Union (IoU) as principal metric for chart attribution tasks. Detected regions in the chart image are matched to ground truth regions (e.g., bars in barplot or pies in piechart) based on a threshold value of $\\mathrm { I o U } \\ge 0 . 9 .$ Unlike bar charts and pie charts, where detected regions can be matched to discrete ground truth regions, line charts involve discrete points. Since grounding models generate bounding boxes or regions, we compute the proportion of ground truth points covered within the detected region(s) over total points detected. \n\nBaselines: (1) Zero-shot LLM Bounding Box Prompting – We prompt GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet to predict normalized bounding box coordinates for chart components based on input text and the visual chart. (2) Kosmos-2 [12] is a multimodal LLM with textto-visual grounding capabilities. It represents object locations as Markdown links for generating bounding boxes for visual grounding tasks. (3) LISA (Large Language Instructed Segmentation Assistant) [9] is a reasoning-based zero-shot segmentation model that generates masks from implicit and complex textual queries. \n\n4 Results and Discussion \n\nTable 2(a) shows quantitative results that demonstrate that ChartCitor consistently outperforms the baselines across all chart types, highlighting its robustness and effectiveness in visual chart understanding. ChartCitor achieves better performance compared to directly prompting LLMs to predict bounding boxes. Further, even \n\nusing GPT-4V with set of marks prompting\n\n---Output---\nOutput:",

ACM, New York, NY, USA, 4 pages. https://doi.org/10.1145/ nnnnnnn.nnnnnnn \n\n1 Introduction \n\nChart data finds extensive use across diverse domains such as healthcare, finance, and education. Recently, LLMs such as Llama-3.2 [16], Claude-3.5 Sonnet, and GPT-4V [1] have proven effective in utilizing in-context learning and visual prompting to interpret and reason over chart images. However, these models tend to hallucinate — generate answers with semantically plausible but factually incorrect information — which undermines their reliability and erodes user trust [14, 19]. While existing approaches attempt to address hallucination by grounding LLM-generated responses in source documents through citation mechanisms [7], charts present unique challenges: (i) complex mapping between visual elements and underlying data, (ii) limited contextual information due to compressed visual data representation, (iii) difficulty in localizing chart elements across diverse visualization types and layouts, and (iv) ambiguity in alignment between text descriptions and visual elements. Prior research has explored various approaches to address this challenge, including instruction tuning [8], in-context learning [5], and natural-language inference (NLI)-based post-hoc attribution methods [4]. However, these approaches have primarily focused on attributing entire charts rather than specific structural elements [6], limiting their practical utility. To address these limitations, we propose ChartCitor, a system that provides visual evidence for generated answers by identifying and highlighting relevant chart elements through bounding box annotations. ChartCitor works by orchestrating multiple specialized LLM agents to: (1) extract structured data table from charts, (2) break down answers into logical steps, (3) generate contextual descriptions for rows/columns, (4) identify supporting evidence through pre-filtering and re-ranking to connect specific table cells to claims, and (5) localize the selected cells in the chart image. ChartCitor helps professionals save time on fact-checking LLM-generated answers and enhances user trust by providing reliable and logically-explained citations sourced from charts. \n\n2 ChartCitor \n\nWe aim to solve the Fine-grained Structured Chart Attribution task which involves identifying graph elements (e.g bars, lines, pies in chart images) that support factual claims in a generated text response to a user’s question. We propose ChartCitor (Fig. 1) – a multiagent framework that provides fine-grained citations for generated answers grounded in chart image by orchestrating multiple LLM agents, which is explained as follows: \n\n(1) Chart2Table Extraction Agent: Charts are predominantly present in PDFs or scanned documents that need to be converted into structured table formats (e.g., CSV, or HTML). We utilize GPT-4V to comprehend PDF images and output corresponding HTML without the need for external OCR using few shot prompting to identify cell data across each row/column. We use visual self-reflection [13] to provide the GPT-4V with its own rendered HTML and data table output to check for consistency between the re-plotted LLM output and the original chart. In case of inconsistencies in the data extraction, the LLM refines its output until the extracted table data is error-free. (2) Answer Reformulation Agent: The answer to be attributed, which can be AI-generated or otherwise, may be composed of multiple facts, numerical formulations and multi-hop logic. Each fact may be sourced from a different row/column in the chart table. To facilitate precise citations, re-framing the answer statement into a chain of reasoning steps helps to better retrieve the correct citations from the table. We convert the answer statement into a hierarchy of reasoning thoughts/arguments via few-shot in-context prompting, ensuring the resultant answer arguments are independent sentences without any deviation in their collective meaning from the original answer statement. \n\n(3) Entity Captioning Agent: Understanding tabular data extends beyond simple cell interpretation, requiring comprehension of how cell information relate to both the table’s structure and its broader context. Tables often present analytical challenges through ambiguous content, including technical terminology, contextless numeric values, domain-specific symbols, and hierarchical row/column headers. These ambiguities impede reliable evidence extraction and citation validation through semantic matching.

requiring comprehension of how cell information relate to both the table’s structure and its broader context. Tables often present analytical challenges through ambiguous content, including technical terminology, contextless numeric values, domain-specific symbols, and hierarchical row/column headers. These ambiguities impede reliable evidence extraction and citation validation through semantic matching. Our solution leverages LLMs in an unsupervised manner to generate rich, multi-layered contextual descriptions: (i) Row Captioning: Our system employs GPT-4o to generate comprehensive row-level descriptions that capture complex patterns across features, summarize temporal trends, highlight significant dates and provide comparative analysis with respect to outliers within each row. (ii) Column Captioning: We generate detailed captions for each column using GPT-4o to explain ambiguous measurement units, symbols, empty cell spaces, and technical relationship of it’s contents with corresponding row headers. (iii) Cell Captioning: Row and column-level captions may highlight broader trends but the fine-grained cell level information needs to be contextualized in terms of its associated row and column headers. Captioning agent uses GPT-4o to describe the importance of each cell in the context of its associated row and columns. \\n\\nTable Cell Retrieval: We use retrieve-then-rank approach to identify the most relevant table cells. Our two-step approach begins with LLM-based pre-filtering to reject irrelevant rows and columns. We then employ LLM re-ranking to retrieve the most precise cell-level matches, ensuring both comprehensive coverage and accuracy in the final selection. \\n\\n(4) LLM Pre-filtering Agent: We hypothesize that some of the table rows/ columns are likely to be unrelated to the answer facts. Passing irrelevant and distracting table entities to the LLM-based re-ranker can mislead it, negatively impacting the ranking process. Inspired by [11], the LLM-based pre-filtering step uses chain-of-thought [18] followed by Plan and Solve [17] prompting techniques to generate a relevance score for each row/column based on the significance of its descriptive caption to the given answer statement (between 0 to 1). Additionally, we prompt the LLM to explain its rationale behind the score generation to enhance explainability and avoid hallucinations. We establish a specific threshold (usually $0 . 3 - 0 . 5 )$ ) for row/column filtering to retain potential citations that are sent to the re-ranker, discarding those falling below the threshold. This implementation significantly reduces the number of noisy of rows and columns that can misguide the re-ranker, leading to an improved citation retrieval performance. \\n\\n(5) LLM Re-ranking Agent: LLMs providing citations that don’t directly support their claims can be interpreted as a form of hallucination which may diminish user confidence. To solve this, we retrieve the set of table cells that are collectively both sufficient and directly relevant to the answer claims. We use RankGPT [15], a listwise LLM re-ranker to re-rank the table cells extracted from the intersection of rows and columns selected in the pre-filtering stage. Additionally, we prompt GPT-4o to provide a layer-of-thought [3] explanation of its rationale in ranking the cell items, enhancing the transparency in the citation mechanism by enforcing a logical coherence in the evidence chain. \\n\\n(6) Cell Localization Agent: The final step maps cited table cells to their corresponding visual elements in the chart image. This agent leverages DETR trained [2] on ChartQA data to identify all possible data marks (bars, line segments, pie slices) using image processing algorithms. GPT-4V with few-shot set-of-marks prompting [20] then identifies elements corresponding to the cited cells. The agent generates bounding box coordinates for the relevant visual elements, employing visual self-reflection to verify precise correspondence between highlighted regions and cited data points. \\n\\n3 Implementation Details \\n\\nAll constituent agents utilize textual LLM APIs such as those provided by OpenAI (GPT-4o, GPT-4V) or Claude Sonnet-3.5. We use ChatGPT $- 4 0$ as the base multimodal language model (MLLM) for ChartCitor. We convert data tables from TabCite benchmark [10] into bar/pie/line charts along with paired QA. \\n\\nEvaluation: We adopt visual Intersection over Union (IoU) as principal metric for chart attribution tasks. Detected regions in the chart image are matched to ground truth regions (e.g., bars in barplot or pies in piechart) based on a threshold value of $\\\\mathrm { I o U } \\\\ge 0 . 9 .$ Unlike bar charts and pie charts, where detected regions can be matched to discrete ground truth regions, line charts involve discrete points. Since grounding models generate bounding boxes or regions, we compute the proportion of ground truth points covered within the detected region(s) over total points detected. \\n\\nBaselines: (1) Zero-shot LLM Bounding Box Prompting – We prompt GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet to predict normalized bounding box coordinates for chart components based on input text and the visual chart. (2) Kosmos-2 [12] is a multimodal LLM with textto-visual grounding capabilities. It represents object locations as Markdown links for generating bounding boxes for visual grounding tasks. (3) LISA (Large Language Instructed Segmentation Assistant) [9] is a reasoning-based zero-shot segmentation model that generates masks from implicit and complex textual queries. \\n\\n4 Results and Discussion \\n\\nTable 2(a) shows quantitative results that demonstrate that ChartCitor consistently outperforms the baselines across all chart types, highlighting its robustness and effectiveness in visual chart understanding. ChartCitor achieves better performance compared to directly prompting LLMs to predict bounding boxes.

zero-shot segmentation model that generates masks from implicit and complex textual queries. \\n\\n4 Results and Discussion \\n\\nTable 2(a) shows quantitative results that demonstrate that ChartCitor consistently outperforms the baselines across all chart types, highlighting its robustness and effectiveness in visual chart understanding. ChartCitor achieves better performance compared to directly prompting LLMs to predict bounding boxes. Further, even \\n\\nusing GPT-4V with set of marks prompting over detected chart elements show weak performance. Kosmos-2 and LISA perform poorly, with very low IoU scores, highlighting their inability to handle factual grounding in charts due to insufficient visual and numerical reasoning. Interestingly, all tested method including our proposed ChartCitor, zero-shot LMM prompting, LISA and KOSMOS2 struggle with interpreting complex geometrical proportions in pie charts due to their difficulty in handling non-rectangular bounding box segmentation task. Further, we conducted a user study (Fig. 2(b) to evaluate the citation accuracy and perceived utility of fine-grained chart attribution provided by ChartCitor. Five participants evaluated 250 randomly sampled question-answer pairs with associated chart images to study the usefulness and accuracy of the citations provided by ChartCitor compared to direct GPT-4o prompting. The evaluation results demonstrated strong positive reception, with participants rating the attributions as Completely Accurate $4 1 \\\\%$ vs $2 8 \\\\%$ ) or Somewhat Accurate ( $1 7 \\\\%$ vs $1 5 \\\\%$ ) for verifying chart-based question answering accuracy in ChartCitor and GPT-4o, respectively. Attributions were found to be more \\\"Completely Inaccurate\\\" ChartCitor than GPT-4o ( $1 7 \\\\%$ vs $3 1 \\\\%$ ). Participants described the citations as a handy tool in making verification of LLM-generated answers easier (\\\"...can help me to quickly verify trends in charts, cutting down the time I spent on 10 documents from 5 hrs to 20 mins.\\\"). \\n\\n5 Conclusion \\n\\nWe introduced ChartCitor, which grounds LLM-generated QA responses to chart elements using agentic orchestration and set-ofmarks prompting. The system outperforms baselines by $9 . 1 5 \\\\%$ and shows promise for rich document QA over PDF collections. While currently effective for single-chart citations, future work can address multi-chart interactions, hallucination mitigation, and explicit citation-text mapping to enhance trustworthy multimodal content generation. \\n\\nReferences \\n\\n[1] Josh Achiam, Steven Adler, Sandhini Agarwal, Lama Ahmad, Ilge Akkaya, Florencia Leoni Aleman, Diogo Almeida, Janko Altenschmidt, Sam Altman, Shyamal Anadkat, et al. 2023.

Language Models (LLMs) can perform chart question-answering tasks but often generate unverified hallucinated responses. Existing answer attribution methods struggle to ground responses in source charts due to limited visual-semantic context, complex visual-text alignment requirements, and difficulties in bounding box prediction across complex layouts. We present ChartCitor, a multi-agent framework that provides fine-grained bounding box citations by identifying supporting evidence within chart images. The system orchestrates LLM agents to perform chart-to-table extraction, answer reformulation, table augmentation, evidence retrieval through prefiltering and re-ranking, and table-to-chart mapping. ChartCitor outperforms existing baselines across different chart types. Qualitative user studies show that ChartCitor helps increase user trust in Generative AI by providing enhanced explainability for LLMassisted chart QA and enables professionals to be more productive. \\n\\nCCS Concepts \\n\\n• Information systems Information extraction. \\n\\nKeywords \\n\\nVisual Fact Checking, Information Extraction, Multimodal Retrieval, LLM Agents \\n\\nACM Reference Format: \\n\\nKanika Goswami, Puneet Mathur, Ryan Rossi, and Franck Dernoncourt. 2025.

ACM, New York, NY, USA, 4 pages. https://doi.org/10.1145/ nnnnnnn.nnnnnnn \\n\\n1 Introduction \\n\\nChart data finds extensive use across diverse domains such as healthcare, finance, and education. Recently, LLMs such as Llama-3.2 [16], Claude-3.5 Sonnet, and GPT-4V [1] have proven effective in utilizing in-context learning and visual prompting to interpret and reason over chart images. However, these models tend to hallucinate — generate answers with semantically plausible but factually incorrect information — which undermines their reliability and erodes user trust [14, 19]. While existing approaches attempt to address hallucination by grounding LLM-generated responses in source documents through citation mechanisms [7], charts present unique challenges: (i) complex mapping between visual elements and underlying data, (ii) limited contextual information due to compressed visual data representation, (iii) difficulty in localizing chart elements across diverse visualization types and layouts, and (iv) ambiguity in alignment between text descriptions and visual elements. Prior research has explored various approaches to address this challenge, including instruction tuning [8], in-context learning [5], and natural-language inference (NLI)-based post-hoc attribution methods [4]. However, these approaches have primarily focused on attributing entire charts rather than specific structural elements [6], limiting their practical utility. To address these limitations, we propose ChartCitor, a system that provides visual evidence for generated answers by identifying and highlighting relevant chart elements through bounding box annotations. ChartCitor works by orchestrating multiple specialized LLM agents to: (1) extract structured data table from charts, (2) break down answers into logical steps, (3) generate contextual descriptions for rows/columns, (4) identify supporting evidence through pre-filtering and re-ranking to connect specific table cells to claims, and (5) localize the selected cells in the chart image. ChartCitor helps professionals save time on fact-checking LLM-generated answers and enhances user trust by providing reliable and logically-explained citations sourced from charts. \\n\\n2 ChartCitor \\n\\nWe aim to solve the Fine-grained Structured Chart Attribution task which involves identifying graph elements (e.g bars, lines, pies in chart images) that support factual claims in a generated text response to a user’s question. We propose ChartCitor (Fig. 1) – a multiagent framework that provides fine-grained citations for generated answers grounded in chart image by orchestrating multiple LLM agents, which is explained as follows: \\n\\n(1) Chart2Table Extraction Agent: Charts are predominantly present in PDFs or scanned documents that need to be converted into structured table formats (e.g., CSV, or HTML). We utilize GPT-4V to comprehend PDF images and output corresponding HTML without the need for external OCR using few shot prompting to identify cell data across each row/column. We use visual self-reflection [13] to provide the GPT-4V with its own rendered HTML and data table output to check for consistency between the re-plotted LLM output and the original chart. In case of inconsistencies in the data extraction, the LLM refines its output until the extracted table data is error-free. (2) Answer Reformulation Agent: The answer to be attributed, which can be AI-generated or otherwise, may be composed of multiple facts, numerical formulations and multi-hop logic. Each fact may be sourced from a different row/column in the chart table. To facilitate precise citations, re-framing the answer statement into a chain of reasoning steps helps to better retrieve the correct citations from the table. We convert the answer statement into a hierarchy of reasoning thoughts/arguments via few-shot in-context prompting, ensuring the resultant answer arguments are independent sentences without any deviation in their collective meaning from the original answer statement. \\n\\n(3) Entity Captioning Agent: Understanding tabular data extends beyond simple cell interpretation, requiring comprehension of how cell information relate to both the table’s structure and its broader context. Tables often present analytical challenges through ambiguous content, including technical terminology, contextless numeric values, domain-specific symbols, and hierarchical row/column headers. These ambiguities impede reliable evidence extraction and citation validation through semantic matching. Our solution leverages LLMs in an unsupervised manner to generate rich, multi-layered contextual descriptions: (i) Row Captioning: Our\\n\\n---Output---\\nOutput:\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"ChartCitor\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"ChartCitor is a multi-agent framework designed to provide fine-grained bounding box citations for chart question-answering tasks, enhancing the reliability of LLM-generated responses.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Kanika Goswami\\\"<|>\\\"person\\\"<|>\\\"Kanika Goswami is associated with IGDTUW in Delhi, India, contributing to the development of the ChartCitor framework.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Puneet Mathur\\\"<|>\\\"person\\\"<|>\\\"Puneet Mathur is affiliated with Adobe Research in the USA and is part of the team that developed ChartCitor.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Ryan Rossi\\\"<|>\\\"person\\\"<|>\\\"Ryan Rossi works at Adobe Research in the USA, contributing to the ChartCitor project.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Franck Dernoncourt\\\"<|>\\\"person\\\"<|>\\\"Franck Dernoncourt is a team member at Adobe Research in the USA, involved in the ChartCitor framework development.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"LLMs\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"LLMs, or large language models, are AI systems capable of performing chart question-answering tasks, though they often generate unverified responses.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Fine-grained Structured Chart Attribution\\\"<|>\\\"event\\\"<|>\\\"Fine-grained Structured Chart Attribution is a task aimed at identifying specific chart elements that support factual claims in generated text responses.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Multiple LLM Agents\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Multiple LLM Agents refers to the various specialized AI models working together within ChartCitor to enhance the reliability of chart-based answers.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Visual Fact Checking\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Visual Fact Checking is a method for verifying information generated by LLMs, particularly in the context of chart data.\\\")##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"ChartCitor\\\"<|>\\\"Kanika Goswami\\\"<|>\\\"Kanika Goswami is a key contributor to the ChartCitor framework at IGDTUW, indicating her role in its development.\\\"<|>\\\"organizational contribution, development team\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"ChartCitor\\\"<|>\\\"Puneet Mathur\\\"<|>\\\"Puneet Mathur plays a significant role in the development of ChartCitor at Adobe Research, highlighting his contribution to the project.\\\"<|>\\\"organizational contribution, development team\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"ChartCitor\\\"<|>\\\"Ryan Rossi\\\"<|>\\\"Ryan Rossi is involved in the development of ChartCitor, contributing to its capabilities as a member of the Adobe Research team.\\\"<|>\\\"organizational contribution, development team\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"ChartCitor\\\"<|>\\\"Franck Dernoncourt\\\"<|>\\\"Franck Dernoncourt is one of the developers of ChartCitor at Adobe Research, highlighting his involvement in the project's success.\\\"<|>\\\"organizational contribution, development team\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"LLMs\\\"<|>\\\"Fine-grained Structured Chart Attribution\\\"<|>\\\"LLMs are instrumental in addressing the Fine-grained Structured Chart Attribution task within the ChartCitor framework.\\\"<|>\\\"functionality, task support\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Fine-grained Structured Chart Attribution\\\"<|>\\\"Multiple LLM Agents\\\"<|>\\\"Multiple LLM Agents are utilized in the task of Fine-grained Structured Chart Attribution, showcasing their collaborative function.\\\"<|>\\\"task execution, collaboration\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Visual Fact Checking\\\"<|>\\\"LLMs\\\"<|>\\\"Visual Fact Checking utilizes the capabilities of LLMs to verify information, particularly in chart-related contexts.\\\"<|>\\\"verification method, AI application\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"content_keywords\\\"<|>\\\"chart question-answering, LLMs, citation mechanism, information extraction, visual fact checking\\\")<|COMPLETE|>\"}]\nMANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

It was this competitive undercurrent that kept him alert, the sense that his and Jordan's shared commitment to discovery was an unspoken rebellion against Cruz's narrowing vision of control and order.\n\nThen Taylor did something unexpected. They paused beside Jordan and, for a moment, observed the device with something akin to reverence. \"If this tech can be understood...\" Taylor said, their voice quieter, \"It could change the game for us.

The table presents the performance of different methods in a chart attribution task, quantified by Intersection over Union (IoU) scores. Structure is simple with two columns: 'Method' and 'IoU.' Key insights indicate that ChartCitor outperforms all other methods with an IoU of 27.4, signifying superior accuracy in visual data interpretation. Notably, DETR combined with Set-of-Marks Prompting yields an IoU of 18.6, while traditional models like Kosmos-2 and LISA show significantly lower scores at 3.89 and 4.34 respectively. The trend emphasizes the increasing effectiveness of tailored methods, asserting that advanced prompting techniques enhance model performance significantly. This data correlates with the surrounding content, illustrating the challenged capabilities of existing models in accurately interpreting visual data and validating the contextual efficacy of the ChartCitor system as a robust solution for improving citation accuracy.\n\n---Output---\nOutput:",

None\\n\\nAnalysis: The table presents the performance of different methods in a chart attribution task, quantified by Intersection over Union (IoU) scores. Structure is simple with two columns: 'Method' and 'IoU.' Key insights indicate that ChartCitor outperforms all other methods with an IoU of 27.4, signifying superior accuracy in visual data interpretation. Notably, DETR combined with Set-of-Marks Prompting yields an IoU of 18.6, while traditional models like Kosmos-2 and LISA show significantly lower scores at 3.89 and 4.34 respectively. The trend emphasizes the increasing effectiveness of tailored methods, asserting that advanced prompting techniques enhance model performance significantly. This data correlates with the surrounding content, illustrating the challenged capabilities of existing models in accurately interpreting visual data and validating the contextual efficacy of the ChartCitor system as a robust solution for improving citation accuracy.\\n\\n---Output---\\nOutput:\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"ChartCitor\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"ChartCitor is an advanced method that achieves the highest Intersection over Union (IoU) score of 27.4 in a chart attribution task, indicating superior performance in visual data interpretation.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"DETR\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"DETR is a method that, when combined with Set-of-Marks Prompting, achieves an IoU of 18.6 in chart attribution tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness in visual data processing.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Kosmos-2\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"Kosmos-2 is a method that received a relatively low IoU score of 3.89, indicating challenges in accurately interpreting visual data.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"LISA\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"LISA is a method with an IoU score of 4.34, reflecting its limited effectiveness in chart attribution compared to more advanced techniques.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Set-of-Marks Prompting\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Set-of-Marks Prompting is a technique used in conjunction with DETR to improve the IoU score in visual data tasks, enhancing model performance significantly.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Intersection over Union (IoU)\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Intersection over Union (IoU) is a metric used to measure the accuracy of methods in visual data interpretation tasks, expressed as numerical scores in this context.\\\")##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"ChartCitor\\\"<|>\\\"Intersection over Union (IoU)\\\"<|>\\\"ChartCitor achieved the highest IoU score of 27.4, highlighting its effectiveness in visual data interpretation tasks.\\\"<|>\\\"performance measure, advanced method\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"DETR\\\"<|>\\\"Set-of-Marks Prompting\\\"<|>\\\"The combination of DETR and Set-of-Marks Prompting resulted in a significant IoU score of 18.6, showcasing the benefits of tailored methods.\\\"<|>\\\"method enhancement, performance improvement\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Kosmos-2\\\"<|>\\\"Intersection over Union (IoU)\\\"<|>\\\"Kosmos-2's low IoU score of 3.89 indicates its limited effectiveness in visual data interpretation tasks.\\\"<|>\\\"performance limitation, visual data challenges\\\"<|>6)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"LISA\\\"<|>\\\"Intersection over Union (IoU)\\\"<|>\\\"LISA's IoU score of 4.34 suggests its ineffectiveness relative to newer methods in the context of visual data tasks.\\\"<|>\\\"performance limitation, visual data challenges\\\"<|>5)##\\n(\\\"content_keywords\\\"<|>\\\"chart attribution, visual data interpretation, performance metrics, advanced methods\\\")<|COMPLETE|>\"}]\nMANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
