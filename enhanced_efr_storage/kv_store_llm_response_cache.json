Updating the document encoder $\\mathrm { B E R T } _ { d }$ during training is costly as it requires the document index to be periodically updated as REALM does during pre-training [20]. We do not find this step necessary for strong performance, and keep the document encoder (and index) fixed, only fine-tuning the query encoder $\\mathsf { B E R T } _ { q }$ and the BART generator. \n\n2.5 Decoding \n\nAt test time, RAG-Sequence and RAG-Token require different ways to approximate arg $\\operatorname* { m a x } _ { y } p ( y | x )$ \n\nRAG-Token The RAG-Token model can be seen as a standard, autoregressive seq2seq generator with transition probability: $\\begin{array} { r } { p _ { \\theta } ^ { \\prime } ( y _ { i } | x , y _ { 1 : i - 1 } ) = \\sum _ { z \\in \\mathrm { t o p } \\cdot k ( p ( \\cdot | x ) ) } p _ { \\eta } ( z _ { i } | \\overline { { x } } ) p _ { \\theta } ( y _ { i } | x , \\widehat { z } _ { i } , \\chi _ { 1 : i - 1 } ^ { \\sim } ) } \\end{array}$ To decode, we can plug $p _ { \\theta } ^ { \\prime } ( y _ { i } | x , y _ { 1 : i - 1 } )$ into a standard beam decoder. \n\nRAG-Sequence For RAG-Sequence, the likelihood $p ( y | x )$ does not break into a conventional pertoken likelihood, hence we cannot solve it with a single beam search. Instead, we run beam search for each document $z$ , scoring each hypothesis using $p _ { \\theta } ( y _ { i } | x , z , y _ { 1 : i - 1 } )$ . This yields a set of hypotheses $Y$ , some of which may not have appeared in the beams of all documents. To estimate the probability of an hypothesis $y$ we run an additional forward pass for each document $z$ for which $y$ does not appear in the beam, multiply generator probability with $p _ { \\eta } ( z | x )$ and then sum the probabilities across beams for the marginals. We refer to this decoding procedure as “Thorough Decoding.” For longer output sequences, $| Y |$ can become large, requiring many forward passes. For more efficient decoding, we can make a further approximation that $\\dot { p } _ { \\theta } ( y | \\dot { x } , z _ { i } ) \\dot { \\approx } 0$ where $y$ was not generated during beam search from $x , z _ { i }$ . This avoids the need to run additional forward passes once the candidate set $Y$ has been generated. We refer to this decoding procedure as “Fast Decoding.” \n\n3 Experiments \n\nWe experiment with RAG in a wide range of knowledge-intensive tasks. For all experiments, we use a single Wikipedia dump for our non-parametric knowledge source. Following Lee et al. [31] and Karpukhin et al. [26], we use the December 2018 dump. Each Wikipedia article is split into disjoint 100-word chunks, to make a total of 21M documents. We use the document encoder to compute an embedding for each document, and build a single MIPS index using FAISS [23] with a Hierarchical Navigable Small World approximation for fast retrieval [37]. During training, we retrieve the top $k$ documents for each query. We consider $k \\in \\{ 5 , 1 0 \\}$ for training and set $k$ for test time using dev data. We now discuss experimental details for each task. \n\n3.1 Open-domain Question Answering \n\nOpen-domain question answering (QA) is an important real-world application and common testbed for knowledge-intensive tasks [20]. We treat questions and answers as input-output text pairs $( x , y )$ and train RAG by directly minimizing the negative log-likelihood of answers. We compare RAG to the popular extractive QA paradigm [5, 7, 31, 26], where answers are extracted spans from retrieved documents, relying primarily on non-parametric knowledge. We also compare to “Closed-Book QA” approaches [52], which, like RAG, generate answers, but which do not exploit retrieval, instead relying purely on parametric knowledge. We consider four popular open-domain QA datasets: Natural Questions (NQ) [29], TriviaQA (TQA) [24]. WebQuestions (WQ) [3] and CuratedTrec (CT) [2]. As CT and WQ are small, we follow DPR [26] by initializing CT and WQ models with our NQ RAG model. We use the same train/dev/test splits as prior work [31, 26] and report Exact Match (EM) scores. For TQA, to compare with T5 [52], we also evaluate on the TQA Wiki test set. \n\n3.2 Abstractive Question Answering \n\nRAG models can go beyond simple extractive QA and answer questions with free-form, abstractive text generation. To test RAG’s natural language generation (NLG) in a knowledge-intensive setting, we\n\n---Output---\nOutput:",

For FEVER [56] fact verification, we achieve results within $4 . 3 \\%$ of state-of-the-art pipeline models which use strong retrieval supervision. Finally, we demonstrate that the non-parametric memory can be replaced to update the models’ knowledge as the world changes.1 \n\n2 Methods \n\nWe explore RAG models, which use the input sequence $x$ to retrieve text documents $z$ and use them as additional context when generating the target sequence $y$ . As shown in Figure 1, our models leverage two components: (i) a retriever $p _ { \\eta } ( z | x )$ with parameters $\\eta$ that returns (top-K truncated) distributions over text passages given a query $x$ and (ii) a generator $p _ { \\theta } ( y _ { i } | x , z , y _ { 1 : i - 1 } )$ parametrized by $\\theta$ that generates a current token based on a context of the previous $i - 1$ tokens $y _ { 1 : i - 1 }$ , the original input $x$ and a retrieved passage $z$ . \n\nTo train the retriever and generator end-to-end, we treat the retrieved document as a latent variable. We propose two models that marginalize over the latent documents in different ways to produce a distribution over generated text. In one approach, RAG-Sequence, the model uses the same document to predict each target token. The second approach, RAG-Token, can predict each target token based on a different document. In the following, we formally introduce both models and then describe the $p _ { \\eta }$ and $p _ { \\theta }$ components, as well as the training and decoding procedure. \n\n2.1 Models \n\nRAG-Sequence Model The RAG-Sequence model uses the same retrieved document to generate the complete sequence. Technically, it treats the retrieved document as a single latent variable that is marginalized to get the seq2seq probability $p ( y | x )$ via a top-K approximation. Concretely, the top $\\mathbf { K }$ documents are retrieved using the retriever, and the generator produces the output sequence probability for each document, which are then marginalized, \n\nRAG-Token Model In the RAG-Token model we can draw a different latent document for each target token and marginalize accordingly. This allows the generator to choose content from several documents when producing an answer. Concretely, the top K documents are retrieved using the retriever, and then the generator produces a distribution for the next output token for each document, before marginalizing, and repeating the process with the following output token, Formally, we define: \n\nFinally, we note that RAG can be used for sequence classification tasks by considering the target class as a target sequence of length one, in which case RAG-Sequence and RAG-Token are equivalent. \n\n2.2 Retriever: DPR \n\nThe retrieval component $p _ { \\eta } ( z | x )$ is based on DPR [26]. DPR follows a bi-encoder architecture: \n\nwhere $\\mathbf { d } ( z )$ is a dense representation of a document produced by a BERTBASE document encoder [8], and $\\mathbf { q } ( x )$ a query representation produced by a query encoder, also based on BERTBASE. Calculating top- $\\cdot \\mathbf { k } ( p _ { \\eta } ( \\cdot | x ) )$ , the list of $k$ documents $z$ with highest prior probability $p _ { \\eta } ( z | x )$ , is a Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS) problem, which can be approximately solved in sub-linear time [23]. We use a pre-trained bi-encoder from DPR to initialize our retriever and to build the document index. This retriever was trained to retrieve documents which contain answers to TriviaQA [24] questions and Natural Questions [29]. We refer to the document index as the non-parametric memory. \n\n2.3 Generator: BART \n\nThe generator component $p _ { \\theta } ( y _ { i } | x , z , y _ { 1 : i - 1 } )$ could be modelled using any encoder-decoder. We use BART-large [32], a pre-trained seq2seq transformer [58] with 400M parameters. To combine the input $x$ with the retrieved content $z$ when generating from BART, we simply concatenate them. BART was pre-trained using a denoising objective and a variety of different noising functions. It has obtained state-of-the-art results on a diverse set of generation tasks and outperforms comparably-sized T5 models [32]. We refer to the BART generator parameters $\\theta$ as the parametric memory henceforth. \n\n2.4 Training \n\nWe jointly train the retriever and generator components without any direct supervision on what document should be retrieved. Given a fine-tuning training corpus of input/output pairs $( x _ { j } , y _ { j } )$ , we minimize the negative marginal log-likelihood of each target, $\\Sigma _ { j } - \\log p ( y _ { j } | x _ { j } )$ using stochastic gradient descent with Adam [28]. Updating the document encoder $\\mathrm { B E R T } _ { d }$ during training is costly as it requires the document index to be periodically updated as REALM does during pre-training [20]. We do not find this step necessary for strong performance, and keep the document encoder (and index) fixed, only fine-t\n\n---Output---\nOutput:",

For TQA, to compare with T5 [52], we also evaluate on the TQA Wiki test set. \n\n3.2 Abstractive Question Answering \n\nRAG models can go beyond simple extractive QA and answer questions with free-form, abstractive text generation. To test RAG’s natural language generation (NLG) in a knowledge-intensive setting, we use the MSMARCO NLG task v2.1 [43]. The task consists of questions, ten gold passages retrieved from a search engine for each question, and a full sentence answer annotated from the retrieved passages. We do not use the supplied passages, only the questions and answers, to treat \n\nMSMARCO as an open-domain abstractive QA task. MSMARCO has some questions that cannot be answered in a way that matches the reference answer without access to the gold passages, such as “What is the weather in Volcano, CA?” so performance will be lower without using gold passages. We also note that some MSMARCO questions cannot be answered using Wikipedia alone. Here, RAG can rely on parametric knowledge to generate reasonable responses. \n\n3.3 Jeopardy Question Generation \n\nTo evaluate RAG’s generation abilities in a non-QA setting, we study open-domain question generation. Rather than use questions from standard open-domain QA tasks, which typically consist of short, simple questions, we propose the more demanding task of generating Jeopardy questions. Jeopardy is an unusual format that consists of trying to guess an entity from a fact about that entity. For example, “The World Cup” is the answer to the question “In 1986 Mexico scored as the first country to host this international sports competition twice.” As Jeopardy questions are precise, factual statements, generating Jeopardy questions conditioned on their answer entities constitutes a challenging knowledge-intensive generation task. \n\nWe use the splits from SearchQA [10], with 100K train, 14K dev, and 27K test examples. As this is a new task, we train a BART model for comparison. Following [67], we evaluate using the SQuAD-tuned Q-BLEU-1 metric [42]. Q-BLEU is a variant of BLEU with a higher weight for matching entities and has higher correlation with human judgment for question generation than standard metrics. We also perform two human evaluations, one to assess generation factuality, and one for specificity. We define factuality as whether a statement can be corroborated by trusted external sources, and specificity as high mutual dependence between the input and output [33]. We follow best practice and use pairwise comparative evaluation [34]. Evaluators are shown an answer and two generated questions, one from BART and one from RAG. They are then asked to pick one of four options—quuestion A is better, question B is better, both are good, or neither is good. \n\n3.4 Fact Verification \n\nFEVER [56] requires classifying whether a natural language claim is supported or refuted by Wikipedia, or whether there is not enough information to decide. The task requires retrieving evidence from Wikipedia relating to the claim and then reasoning over this evidence to classify whether the claim is true, false, or unverifiable from Wikipedia alone. FEVER is a retrieval problem coupled with an challenging entailment reasoning task. It also provides an appropriate testbed for exploring the RAG models’ ability to handle classification rather than generation. We map FEVER class labels (supports, refutes, or not enough info) to single output tokens and directly train with claim-class pairs. Crucially, unlike most other approaches to FEVER, we do not use supervision on retrieved evidence. In many real-world applications, retrieval supervision signals aren’t available, and models that do not require such supervision will be applicable to a wider range of tasks. We explore two variants: the standard 3-way classification task (supports/refutes/not enough info) and the 2-way (supports/refutes) task studied in Thorne and Vlachos [57]. In both cases we report label accuracy. \n\n4 Results \n\n4.1 Open-domain Question Answering \n\nTable 1 shows results for RAG along with state-of-the-art models. On all four open-domain QA tasks, RAG sets a new state of the art (only on the T5-comparable split for TQA). RAG combines the generation flexibility of the “closed-book” (parametric only) approaches and the performance of \"open-book\" retrieval-based approaches. Unlike REALM and $\\mathrm { T } 5 { + } \\mathrm { S S M }$ , RAG enjoys strong results without expensive, specialized “salient span masking” pre-training [20]. It is worth noting that RAG’s retriever is initialized using DPR’s retriever, which uses retrieval supervision on Natural Questions and TriviaQA. RAG compares favourably to the DPR QA system, which uses a BERT-based “crossencoder” to re-rank documents, along with an extractive reader. RAG demonstrates that neither a re-ranker nor extractive reader is necessary for state-of-the-art performance. \n\nThere are several advantages to generating answers even when it is possible to extract them. Documents with clues about the answer but do not contain the answer verbatim can still contribute towards a correct answer being generated, which is not possible with standard extractive approaches, leading to more effective marginalization over documents. Furthermore, RAG can generate correct answers even when the correct answer is not in any retrieved document, achieving $1 1 . 8 \\%$ accuracy in such cases for NQ, where an extractive model would score $0 \\%$ . \n\n4.2 Abstractive Question Answering \n\nAs shown in Table 2, R\n\n---Output---\nOutput:",

that are more factual, specific, and diverse than a BART baseline. For FEVER [56] fact verification, we achieve results within $4 . 3 \\\\%$ of state-of-the-art pipeline models which use strong retrieval supervision. Finally, we demonstrate that the non-parametric memory can be replaced to update the models’ knowledge as the world changes.1 \\n\\n2 Methods \\n\\nWe explore RAG models, which use the input sequence $x$ to retrieve text documents $z$ and use them as additional context when generating the target sequence $y$ . As shown in Figure 1, our models leverage two components: (i) a retriever $p _ { \\\\eta } ( z | x )$ with parameters $\\\\eta$ that returns (top-K truncated) distributions over text passages given a query $x$ and (ii) a generator $p _ { \\\\theta } ( y _ { i } | x , z , y _ { 1 : i - 1 } )$ parametrized by $\\\\theta$ that generates a current token based on a context of the previous $i - 1$ tokens $y _ { 1 : i - 1 }$ , the original input $x$ and a retrieved passage $z$ . \\n\\nTo train the retriever and generator end-to-end, we treat the retrieved document as a latent variable. We propose two models that marginalize over the latent documents in different ways to produce a distribution over generated text. In one approach, RAG-Sequence, the model uses the same document to predict each target token. The second approach, RAG-Token, can predict each target token based on a different document. In the following, we formally introduce both models and then describe the $p _ { \\\\eta }$ and $p _ { \\\\theta }$ components, as well as the training and decoding procedure. \\n\\n2.1 Models \\n\\nRAG-Sequence Model The RAG-Sequence model uses the same retrieved document to generate the complete sequence. Technically, it treats the retrieved document as a single latent variable that is marginalized to get the seq2seq probability $p ( y | x )$ via a top-K approximation. Concretely, the top $\\\\mathbf { K }$ documents are retrieved using the retriever, and the generator produces the output sequence probability for each document, which are then marginalized, \\n\\nRAG-Token Model In the RAG-Token model we can draw a different latent document for each target token and marginalize accordingly. This allows the generator to choose content from several documents when producing an answer. Concretely, the top K documents are retrieved using the retriever, and then the generator produces a distribution for the next output token for each document, before marginalizing, and repeating the process with the following output token, Formally, we define: \\n\\nFinally, we note that RAG can be used for sequence classification tasks by considering the target class as a target sequence of length one, in which case RAG-Sequence and RAG-Token are equivalent. \\n\\n2.2 Retriever: DPR \\n\\nThe retrieval component $p _ { \\\\eta } ( z | x )$ is based on DPR [26]. DPR follows a bi-encoder architecture: \\n\\nwhere $\\\\mathbf { d } ( z )$ is a dense representation of a document produced by a BERTBASE document encoder [8], and $\\\\mathbf { q } ( x )$ a query representation produced by a query encoder, also based on BERTBASE. Calculating top- $\\\\cdot \\\\mathbf { k } ( p _ { \\\\eta } ( \\\\cdot | x ) )$ , the list of $k$ documents $z$ with highest prior probability $p _ { \\\\eta } ( z | x )$ , is a Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS) problem, which can be approximately solved in sub-linear time [23]. We use a pre-trained bi-encoder from DPR to initialize our retriever and to build the document index. This retriever was trained to retrieve documents which contain answers to TriviaQA [24] questions and Natural Questions [29]. We refer to the document index as the non-parametric memory. \\n\\n2.3 Generator: BART \\n\\nThe generator component $p _ { \\\\theta } ( y _ { i } | x , z , y _ { 1 : i - 1 } )$ could be modelled using any encoder-decoder. We use BART-large [32], a pre-trained seq2seq transformer [58] with 400M parameters. To combine the input $x$ with the retrieved content $z$ when generating from BART, we simply concatenate them. BART was pre-trained using a denoising objective and a variety of different noising functions. It has obtained state-of-the-art results on a diverse set of generation tasks and outperforms comparably-sized T5 models [32]. We refer to the BART generator parameters $\\\\theta$ as the parametric memory henceforth. \\n\\n2.4 Training \\n\\nWe jointly train the retriever and generator components without any direct supervision on what document should be retrieved. Given a fine-tuning training corpus of input/output pairs $( x _ { j } , y _ { j } )$ , we minimize the negative marginal log-likelihood of each target, $\\\\Sigma _ { j } - \\\\log p ( y _ { j } | x _ { j } )$ using stochastic gradient descent with Adam [28]. Updating the document encoder $\\\\mathrm { B E R T } _ { d }$ during training is costly as it requires the document index to be periodically updated as REALM does during pre-training [20]. We do not find this step necessary for strong performance, and keep the document encoder (and index) fixed, only fine-t\\n\\n---Output---\\nOutput:\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"BART\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"BART is a pre-trained seq2seq transformer, known for its strong performance on diverse generation tasks, utilizing a denoising objective.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"DPR\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"DPR is a retrieval component that follows a bi-encoder architecture for document retrieval, often utilized in question-answering tasks.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"RAG-Sequence Model\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"The RAG-Sequence model utilizes a single retrieved document to generate a complete target sequence.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"RAG-Token Model\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"The RAG-Token model generates each target token using potentially different retrieved documents, allowing for varied context.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Natural Questions\\\"<|>\\\"event\\\"<|>\\\"Natural Questions is a task designed for evaluating the effectiveness of retrieval-based question-answering systems.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"TriviaQA\\\"<|>\\\"event\\\"<|>\\\"TriviaQA is a dataset for training and evaluating question-answering systems, designed to provide varied and challenging questions.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"BERTBASE\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"BERTBASE is a model used for encoding queries and documents in the retrieval process, facilitating effective information retrieval.\\\")##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"RAG-Sequence Model\\\"<|>\\\"BART\\\"<|>\\\"The RAG-Sequence Model uses BART as its generator component to produce sequences based on retrieved documents.\\\"<|>\\\"model dependency, generation process\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"RAG-Token Model\\\"<|>\\\"BART\\\"<|>\\\"The RAG-Token Model employs BART for generating tokens based on multiple retrieved documents, allowing for diverse responses.\\\"<|>\\\"model dependency, generation process\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"DPR\\\"<|>\\\"RAG-Sequence Model\\\"<|>\\\"DPR serves as the retrieval component for the RAG-Sequence model, providing necessary documents for generation.\\\"<|>\\\"information retrieval, model integration\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"DPR\\\"<|>\\\"RAG-Token Model\\\"<|>\\\"DPR also functions in conjunction with the RAG-Token model to supply documents necessary for generating outputs.\\\"<|>\\\"information retrieval, model integration\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Natural Questions\\\"<|>\\\"DPR\\\"<|>\\\"DPR was trained to retrieve documents containing answers for the Natural Questions dataset, demonstrating its application in real tasks.\\\"<|>\\\"dataset application, training context\\\"<|>7)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"TriviaQA\\\"<|>\\\"DPR\\\"<|>\\\"DPR has also been trained to retrieve documents for the TriviaQA dataset, showing its versatility in question-answering systems.\\\"<|>\\\"dataset application, training context\\\"<|>7)##\\n(\\\"content_keywords\\\"<|>\\\"document retrieval, model training, sequence generation, question answering, transformer models\\\")<|COMPLETE|>\"}]\nMANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

and report Exact Match (EM) scores. For TQA, to compare with T5 [52], we also evaluate on the TQA Wiki test set. \\n\\n3.2 Abstractive Question Answering \\n\\nRAG models can go beyond simple extractive QA and answer questions with free-form, abstractive text generation. To test RAG’s natural language generation (NLG) in a knowledge-intensive setting, we use the MSMARCO NLG task v2.1 [43]. The task consists of questions, ten gold passages retrieved from a search engine for each question, and a full sentence answer annotated from the retrieved passages. We do not use the supplied passages, only the questions and answers, to treat \\n\\nMSMARCO as an open-domain abstractive QA task. MSMARCO has some questions that cannot be answered in a way that matches the reference answer without access to the gold passages, such as “What is the weather in Volcano, CA?” so performance will be lower without using gold passages. We also note that some MSMARCO questions cannot be answered using Wikipedia alone. Here, RAG can rely on parametric knowledge to generate reasonable responses. \\n\\n3.3 Jeopardy Question Generation \\n\\nTo evaluate RAG’s generation abilities in a non-QA setting, we study open-domain question generation. Rather than use questions from standard open-domain QA tasks, which typically consist of short, simple questions, we propose the more demanding task of generating Jeopardy questions. Jeopardy is an unusual format that consists of trying to guess an entity from a fact about that entity. For example, “The World Cup” is the answer to the question “In 1986 Mexico scored as the first country to host this international sports competition twice.” As Jeopardy questions are precise, factual statements, generating Jeopardy questions conditioned on their answer entities constitutes a challenging knowledge-intensive generation task. \\n\\nWe use the splits from SearchQA [10], with 100K train, 14K dev, and 27K test examples. As this is a new task, we train a BART model for comparison. Following [67], we evaluate using the SQuAD-tuned Q-BLEU-1 metric [42]. Q-BLEU is a variant of BLEU with a higher weight for matching entities and has higher correlation with human judgment for question generation than standard metrics. We also perform two human evaluations, one to assess generation factuality, and one for specificity. We define factuality as whether a statement can be corroborated by trusted external sources, and specificity as high mutual dependence between the input and output [33]. We follow best practice and use pairwise comparative evaluation [34]. Evaluators are shown an answer and two generated questions, one from BART and one from RAG. They are then asked to pick one of four options—quuestion A is better, question B is better, both are good, or neither is good. \\n\\n3.4 Fact Verification \\n\\nFEVER [56] requires classifying whether a natural language claim is supported or refuted by Wikipedia, or whether there is not enough information to decide. The task requires retrieving evidence from Wikipedia relating to the claim and then reasoning over this evidence to classify whether the claim is true, false, or unverifiable from Wikipedia alone. FEVER is a retrieval problem coupled with an challenging entailment reasoning task. It also provides an appropriate testbed for exploring the RAG models’ ability to handle classification rather than generation. We map FEVER class labels (supports, refutes, or not enough info) to single output tokens and directly train with claim-class pairs. Crucially, unlike most other approaches to FEVER, we do not use supervision on retrieved evidence. In many real-world applications, retrieval supervision signals aren’t available, and models that do not require such supervision will be applicable to a wider range of tasks. We explore two variants: the standard 3-way classification task (supports/refutes/not enough info) and the 2-way (supports/refutes) task studied in Thorne and Vlachos [57]. In both cases we report label accuracy. \\n\\n4 Results \\n\\n4.1 Open-domain Question Answering \\n\\nTable 1 shows results for RAG along with state-of-the-art models. On all four open-domain QA tasks, RAG sets a new state of the art (only on the T5-comparable split for TQA). RAG combines the generation flexibility of the “closed-book” (parametric only) approaches and the performance of \\\"open-book\\\" retrieval-based approaches. Unlike REALM and $\\\\mathrm { T } 5 { + } \\\\mathrm { S S M }$ , RAG enjoys strong results without expensive, specialized “salient span masking” pre-training [20]. It is worth noting that RAG’s retriever is initialized using DPR’s retriever, which uses retrieval supervision on Natural Questions and TriviaQA. RAG compares favourably to the DPR QA system, which uses a BERT-based “crossencoder” to re-rank documents, along with an extractive reader. RAG demonstrates that neither a re-ranker nor extractive reader is necessary for state-of-the-art performance. \\n\\nThere are several advantages to generating answers even when it is possible to extract them. Documents with clues about the answer but do not contain the answer verbatim can still contribute towards a correct answer being generated, which is not possible with standard extractive approaches, leading to more effective marginalization over documents. Furthermore, RAG can generate correct answers even when the correct answer is not in any retrieved document, achieving $1 1 . 8 \\\\%$ accuracy in such cases for NQ, where an extractive model would score $0 \\\\%$ . \\n\\n4.2 Abstractive Question Answering \\n\\nAs shown in Table 2, R\\n\\n---Output---\\nOutput:\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"RAG Models\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"RAG Models represent a system used for question answering, known for combining generation flexibility and performance in open-domain tasks.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"MSMARCO NLG task v2.1\\\"<|>\\\"event\\\"<|>\\\"The MSMARCO NLG task v2.1 is an evaluative event in natural language generation that involves answering knowledge-intensive questions.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"SearchQA\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"SearchQA is an organization that provides a dataset for evaluating the generation of questions in open-domain settings.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"FEVER\\\"<|>\\\"event\\\"<|>\\\"FEVER is a task focused on fact verification, determining the veracity of claims supported by Wikipedia.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"TQA Wiki test set\\\"<|>\\\"event\\\"<|>\\\"The TQA Wiki test set is a dataset used for evaluating performance on question answering tasks related to TQA.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"BART Model\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"The BART model is a language model employed for comparison in the context of question generation tasks.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"SQuAD-tuned Q-BLEU-1 Metric\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"The SQuAD-tuned Q-BLEU-1 metric is a variant of BLEU used to measure the quality of generated questions by emphasizing entity matching.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Natural Questions\\\"<|>\\\"event\\\"<|>\\\"Natural Questions is a dataset used for training and evaluating question answering systems in a natural language context.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"TriviaQA\\\"<|>\\\"event\\\"<|>\\\"TriviaQA is a dataset utilized in the field of QA, allowing for the training of models on trivia questions.\\\")##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"RAG Models\\\"<|>\\\"MSMARCO NLG task v2.1\\\"<|>\\\"RAG Models are evaluated using the MSMARCO NLG task v2.1 to test their natural language generation capabilities in a knowledge-intensive setting.\\\"<|>\\\"evaluation, performance testing\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"BART Model\\\"<|>\\\"SearchQA\\\"<|>\\\"The BART Model is used in comparison with models developed using the SearchQA dataset for generating questions.\\\"<|>\\\"model comparison, dataset utilization\\\"<|>7)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"FEVER\\\"<|>\\\"RAG Models\\\"<|>\\\"The RAG models are explored for their ability to handle classification tasks, such as those presented in the FEVER event.\\\"<|>\\\"fact verification, model capability\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Natural Questions\\\"<|>\\\"RAG Models\\\"<|>\\\"The RAG models are trained using the Natural Questions dataset to improve their performance in question answering tasks.\\\"<|>\\\"training dataset, model improvement\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"TQA Wiki test set\\\"<|>\\\"RAG Models\\\"<|>\\\"The performance of RAG Models is evaluated on the TQA Wiki test set, contributing to understanding their effectiveness in QA tasks.\\\"<|>\\\"evaluation metric, model assessment\\\"<|>7)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"SQuAD-tuned Q-BLEU-1 Metric\\\"<|>\\\"BART Model\\\"<|>\\\"The SQuAD-tuned Q-BLEU-1 metric is used for evaluating the output of the BART Model in generating questions.\\\"<|>\\\"evaluation metric, performance analysis\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"content_keywords\\\"<|>\\\"question answering, natural language generation, model evaluation, data sets\\\")<|COMPLETE|>\"}]\nMANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

\\\\log p ( y _ { j } | x _ { j } )$ using stochastic gradient descent with Adam [28]. Updating the document encoder $\\\\mathrm { B E R T } _ { d }$ during training is costly as it requires the document index to be periodically updated as REALM does during pre-training [20]. We do not find this step necessary for strong performance, and keep the document encoder (and index) fixed, only fine-tuning the query encoder $\\\\mathsf { B E R T } _ { q }$ and the BART generator. \\n\\n2.5 Decoding \\n\\nAt test time, RAG-Sequence and RAG-Token require different ways to approximate arg $\\\\operatorname* { m a x } _ { y } p ( y | x )$ \\n\\nRAG-Token The RAG-Token model can be seen as a standard, autoregressive seq2seq generator with transition probability: $\\\\begin{array} { r } { p _ { \\\\theta } ^ { \\\\prime } ( y _ { i } | x , y _ { 1 : i - 1 } ) = \\\\sum _ { z \\\\in \\\\mathrm { t o p } \\\\cdot k ( p ( \\\\cdot | x ) ) } p _ { \\\\eta } ( z _ { i } | \\\\overline { { x } } ) p _ { \\\\theta } ( y _ { i } | x , \\\\widehat { z } _ { i } , \\\\chi _ { 1 : i - 1 } ^ { \\\\sim } ) } \\\\end{array}$ To decode, we can plug $p _ { \\\\theta } ^ { \\\\prime } ( y _ { i } | x , y _ { 1 : i - 1 } )$ into a standard beam decoder. \\n\\nRAG-Sequence For RAG-Sequence, the likelihood $p ( y | x )$ does not break into a conventional pertoken likelihood, hence we cannot solve it with a single beam search. Instead, we run beam search for each document $z$ , scoring each hypothesis using $p _ { \\\\theta } ( y _ { i } | x , z , y _ { 1 : i - 1 } )$ . This yields a set of hypotheses $Y$ , some of which may not have appeared in the beams of all documents. To estimate the probability of an hypothesis $y$ we run an additional forward pass for each document $z$ for which $y$ does not appear in the beam, multiply generator probability with $p _ { \\\\eta } ( z | x )$ and then sum the probabilities across beams for the marginals. We refer to this decoding procedure as “Thorough Decoding.” For longer output sequences, $| Y |$ can become large, requiring many forward passes. For more efficient decoding, we can make a further approximation that $\\\\dot { p } _ { \\\\theta } ( y | \\\\dot { x } , z _ { i } ) \\\\dot { \\\\approx } 0$ where $y$ was not generated during beam search from $x , z _ { i }$ . This avoids the need to run additional forward passes once the candidate set $Y$ has been generated. We refer to this decoding procedure as “Fast Decoding.” \\n\\n3 Experiments \\n\\nWe experiment with RAG in a wide range of knowledge-intensive tasks. For all experiments, we use a single Wikipedia dump for our non-parametric knowledge source. Following Lee et al. [31] and Karpukhin et al. [26], we use the December 2018 dump. Each Wikipedia article is split into disjoint 100-word chunks, to make a total of 21M documents. We use the document encoder to compute an embedding for each document, and build a single MIPS index using FAISS [23] with a Hierarchical Navigable Small World approximation for fast retrieval [37]. During training, we retrieve the top $k$ documents for each query. We consider $k \\\\in \\\\{ 5 , 1 0 \\\\}$ for training and set $k$ for test time using dev data. We now discuss experimental details for each task. \\n\\n3.1 Open-domain Question Answering \\n\\nOpen-domain question answering (QA) is an important real-world application and common testbed for knowledge-intensive tasks [20]. We treat questions and answers as input-output text pairs $( x , y )$ and train RAG by directly minimizing the negative log-likelihood of answers. We compare RAG to the popular extractive QA paradigm [5, 7, 31, 26], where answers are extracted spans from retrieved documents, relying primarily on non-parametric knowledge. We also compare to “Closed-Book QA” approaches [52], which, like RAG, generate answers, but which do not exploit retrieval, instead relying purely on parametric knowledge. We consider four popular open-domain QA datasets: Natural Questions (NQ) [29], TriviaQA (TQA) [24]. WebQuestions (WQ) [3] and CuratedTrec (CT) [2]. As CT and WQ are small, we follow DPR [26] by initializing CT and WQ models with our NQ RAG model. We use the same train/dev/test splits as prior work [31, 26] and report Exact Match (EM) scores. For TQA, to compare with T5 [52], we also evaluate on the TQA Wiki test set. \\n\\n3.2 Abstractive Question Answering \\n\\nRAG models can go beyond simple extractive QA and answer questions with free-form, abstractive text generation.

However, their ability to access and precisely manipulate knowledge is still limited, and hence on knowledge-intensive tasks, their performance lags behind task-specific architectures. Additionally, providing provenance for their decisions and updating their world knowledge remain open research problems. Pretrained models with a differentiable access mechanism to explicit non-parametric memory have so far been only investigated for extractive downstream tasks. We explore a general-purpose fine-tuning recipe for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) — models which combine pre-trained parametric and non-parametric memory for language generation. We introduce RAG models where the parametric memory is a pre-trained seq2seq model and the non-parametric memory is a dense vector index of Wikipedia, accessed with a pre-trained neural retriever. We compare two RAG formulations, one which conditions on the same retrieved passages across the whole generated sequence, and another which can use different passages per token. We fine-tune and evaluate our models on a wide range of knowledgeintensive NLP tasks and set the state of the art on three open domain QA tasks, outperforming parametric seq2seq models and task-specific retrieve-and-extract architectures. For language generation tasks, we find that RAG models generate more specific, diverse and factual language than a state-of-the-art parametric-only seq2seq baseline. \n\n1 Introduction \n\nPre-trained neural language models have been shown to learn a substantial amount of in-depth knowledge from data [47]. They can do so without any access to an external memory, as a parameterized implicit knowledge base [51, 52]. While this development is exciting, such models do have downsides: They cannot easily expand or revise their memory, can’t straightforwardly provide insight into their predictions, and may produce “hallucinations” [38]. Hybrid models that combine parametric memory with non-parametric (i.e., retrieval-based) memories [20, 26, 48] can address some of these issues because knowledge can be directly revised and expanded, and accessed knowledge can be inspected and interpreted. REALM [20] and ORQA [31], two recently introduced models that combine masked language models [8] with a differentiable retriever, have shown promising results, but have only explored open-domain extractive question answering. Here, we bring hybrid parametric and non-parametric memory to the “workhorse of NLP,” i.e. sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models. \n\nWe endow pre-trained, parametric-memory generation models with a non-parametric memory through a general-purpose fine-tuning approach which we refer to as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). We build RAG models where the parametric memory is a pre-trained seq2seq transformer, and the non-parametric memory is a dense vector index of Wikipedia, accessed with a pre-trained neural retriever. We combine these components in a probabilistic model trained end-to-end (Fig. 1). The retriever (Dense Passage Retriever [26], henceforth DPR) provides latent documents conditioned on the input, and the seq2seq model (BART [32]) then conditions on these latent documents together with the input to generate the output. We marginalize the latent documents with a top-K approximation, either on a per-output basis (assuming the same document is responsible for all tokens) or a per-token basis (where different documents are responsible for different tokens). Like T5 [51] or BART, RAG can be fine-tuned on any seq2seq task, whereby both the generator and retriever are jointly learned. \n\nThere has been extensive previous work proposing architectures to enrich systems with non-parametric memory which are trained from scratch for specific tasks, e.g. memory networks [64, 55], stackaugmented networks [25] and memory layers [30]. In contrast, we explore a setting where both parametric and non-parametric memory components are pre-trained and pre-loaded with extensive knowledge. Crucially, by using pre-trained access mechanisms, the ability to access knowledge is present without additional training. \n\nOur results highlight the benefits of combining parametric and non-parametric memory with generation for knowledge-intensive tasks—tasks that humans could not reasonably be expected to perform without access to an external knowledge source. Our RAG models achieve state-of-the-art results on open Natural Questions [29], WebQuestions [3] and CuratedTrec [2] and strongly outperform recent approaches that use specialised pre-training objectives on TriviaQA [24]. Despite these being extractive tasks, we find that unconstrained generation outperforms previous extractive approaches. For knowledge-intensive generation, we experiment with MS-MARCO [1] and Jeopardy question generation, and we find that our models generate responses that are more factual, specific, and diverse than a BART baseline. For FEVER [56] fact verification, we achieve results within $4 . 3 \\%$ of state-of-the-art pipeline models which use strong retrieval supervision. Finally, we demonstrate that the non-parametric memory can be replaced to update the models’ knowledge as the world changes.1 \n\n2 Methods \n\nWe explore RAG models, which use the input sequence $\n\n---Output---\nOutput:",

Furthermore, RAG can generate correct answers even when the correct answer is not in any retrieved document, achieving $1 1 . 8 \\%$ accuracy in such cases for NQ, where an extractive model would score $0 \\%$ . \n\n4.2 Abstractive Question Answering \n\nAs shown in Table 2, RAG-Sequence outperforms BART on Open MS-MARCO NLG by 2.6 Bleu points and 2.6 Rouge-L points. RAG approaches state-of-the-art model performance, which is impressive given that (i) those models access gold passages with specific information required to generate the reference answer , (ii) many questions are unanswerable without the gold passages, and (iii) not all questions are answerable from Wikipedia alone. Table 3 shows some generated answers from our models. Qualitatively, we find that RAG models hallucinate less and generate factually correct text more often than BART. Later, we also show that RAG generations are more diverse than BART generations (see $\\ S 4 . 5 )$ ). \n\n4.3 Jeopardy Question Generation \n\nTable 2 shows that RAG-Token performs better than RAG-Sequence on Jeopardy question generation, with both models outperforming BART on Q-BLEU-1. 4 shows human evaluation results, over 452 pairs of generations from BART and RAG-Token. Evaluators indicated that BART was more factual than RAG in only $7 . 1 \\%$ of cases, while RAG was more factual in $4 2 . 7 \\%$ of cases, and both RAG and BART were factual in a further $17 \\%$ of cases, clearly demonstrating the effectiveness of RAG on the task over a state-of-the-art generation model. Evaluators also find RAG generations to be more specific by a large margin. Table 3 shows typical generations from each model. \n\nJeopardy questions often contain two separate pieces of information, and RAG-Token may perform best because it can generate responses that combine content from several documents. Figure 2 shows an example. When generating “Sun”, the posterior is high for document 2 which mentions “The Sun Also Rises”. Similarly, document 1 dominates the posterior when “A Farewell to Arms” is generated. Intriguingly, after the first token of each book is generated, the document posterior flattens. This observation suggests that the generator can complete the titles without depending on specific documents. In other words, the model’s parametric knowledge is sufficient to complete the titles. We find evidence for this hypothesis by feeding the BART-only baseline with the partial decoding \"The Sun. BART completes the generation \"The Sun Also Rises\" is a novel by this author of \"The Sun Also Rises\" indicating the title \"The Sun Also Rises\" is stored in BART’s parameters. Similarly, BART will complete the partial decoding \"The Sun Also Rises\" is a novel by this author of \"A with \"The Sun Also Rises\" is a novel by this author of \"A Farewell to Arms\". This example shows how parametric and non-parametric memories work together—the non-parametric component helps to guide the generation, drawing out specific knowledge stored in the parametric memory. \n\n4.4 Fact Verification \n\nTable 2 shows our results on FEVER. For 3-way classification, RAG scores are within $4 . 3 \\%$ of state-of-the-art models, which are complex pipeline systems with domain-specific architectures and substantial engineering, trained using intermediate retrieval supervision, which RAG does not require. \n\nDocument 1: his works are considered classics of American literature ... His wartime experiences formed the basis for his novel ”A Farewell to Arms” (1929) ... \n\nDocument 2: ... artists of the 1920s ”Lost Generation” expatriate community. His debut novel, ”The Sun Also Rises”, was published in 1926. \n\nFor 2-way classification, we compare against Thorne and Vlachos [57], who train RoBERTa [35] to classify the claim as true or false given the gold evidence sentence. RAG achieves an accuracy within $2 . 7 \\%$ of this model, despite being supplied with only the claim and retrieving its own evidence. We also analyze whether documents retrieved by RAG correspond to documents annotated as gold evidence in FEVER. We calculate the overlap in article titles between the top $k$ documents retrieved by RAG and gold evidence annotations. We find that the top retrieved document is from a gold article in $71 \\%$ of cases, and a gold article is present in the top 10 retrieved articles in $90 \\%$ of cases. \n\n4.5 Additional Results \n\nGeneration Diversity Section 4.3 shows that RAG models are more factual and specific than BART for Jeopardy question generation. Following recent work on diversity-promoting decoding [33, 59, 39], we also investigate generation diversity by calculating the ratio of distinct ngrams to total ngrams generated by different models. Table 5 shows that RAG-Sequence’s generations are more diverse than RAG-Token’s, and both are significantly more diverse than BART without needing any diversity-promoting decoding. \n\nRetrieval Ablations A key feature of RAG is learning to retrieve relevant information for the task. To assess the effectiveness of the retrieval mechanism, we run ablations where we freeze the retriever during training. As shown in Table 6, learned retrieval improves results for all tasks. \n\nWe compare RAG’s dense retriever to\n\n---Output---\nOutput:",

This approach has also been used in knowledge-intensive dialog, where generators have been conditioned on retrieved text directly, albeit obtained via TF-IDF rather than end-to-end learnt retrieval [9]. \n\nRetrieve-and-Edit approaches Our method shares some similarities with retrieve-and-edit style approaches, where a similar training input-output pair is retrieved for a given input, and then edited to provide a final output. These approaches have proved successful in a number of domains including Machine Translation [18, 22] and Semantic Parsing [21]. Our approach does have several differences, including less of emphasis on lightly editing a retrieved item, but on aggregating content from several pieces of retrieved content, as well as learning latent retrieval, and retrieving evidence documents rather than related training pairs. This said, RAG techniques may work well in these settings, and could represent promising future work. \n\n6 Discussion \n\nIn this work, we presented hybrid generation models with access to parametric and non-parametric memory. We showed that our RAG models obtain state of the art results on open-domain QA. We found that people prefer RAG’s generation over purely parametric BART, finding RAG more factual and specific. We conducted an thorough investigation of the learned retrieval component, validating its effectiveness, and we illustrated how the retrieval index can be hot-swapped to update the model without requiring any retraining. In future work, it may be fruitful to investigate if the two components can be jointly pre-trained from scratch, either with a denoising objective similar to BART or some another objective. Our work opens up new research directions on how parametric and non-parametric memories interact and how to most effectively combine them, showing promise in being applied to a wide variety of NLP tasks. \n\nBroader Impact \n\nThis work offers several positive societal benefits over previous work: the fact that it is more strongly grounded in real factual knowledge (in this case Wikipedia) makes it “hallucinate” less with generations that are more factual, and offers more control and interpretability. RAG could be employed in a wide variety of scenarios with direct benefit to society, for example by endowing it with a medical index and asking it open-domain questions on that topic, or by helping people be more effective at their jobs. \n\nWith these advantages also come potential downsides: Wikipedia, or any potential external knowledge source, will probably never be entirely factual and completely devoid of bias. Since RAG can be employed as a language model, similar concerns as for GPT-2 [50] are valid here, although arguably to a lesser extent, including that it might be used to generate abuse, faked or misleading content in the news or on social media; to impersonate others; or to automate the production of spam/phishing content [54]. Advanced language models may also lead to the automation of various jobs in the coming decades [16]. In order to mitigate these risks, AI systems could be employed to fight against misleading content and automated spam/phishing. \n\nAcknowledgments \n\nThe authors would like to thank the reviewers for their thoughtful and constructive feedback on this paper, as well as HuggingFace for their help in open-sourcing code to run RAG models.

language models have been shown to store factual knowledge in their parameters, and achieve state-of-the-art results when fine-tuned on downstream NLP tasks. However, their ability to access and precisely manipulate knowledge is still limited, and hence on knowledge-intensive tasks, their performance lags behind task-specific architectures. Additionally, providing provenance for their decisions and updating their world knowledge remain open research problems. Pretrained models with a differentiable access mechanism to explicit non-parametric memory have so far been only investigated for extractive downstream tasks. We explore a general-purpose fine-tuning recipe for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) — models which combine pre-trained parametric and non-parametric memory for language generation. We introduce RAG models where the parametric memory is a pre-trained seq2seq model and the non-parametric memory is a dense vector index of Wikipedia, accessed with a pre-trained neural retriever. We compare two RAG formulations, one which conditions on the same retrieved passages across the whole generated sequence, and another which can use different passages per token. We fine-tune and evaluate our models on a wide range of knowledgeintensive NLP tasks and set the state of the art on three open domain QA tasks, outperforming parametric seq2seq models and task-specific retrieve-and-extract architectures. For language generation tasks, we find that RAG models generate more specific, diverse and factual language than a state-of-the-art parametric-only seq2seq baseline. \\n\\n1 Introduction \\n\\nPre-trained neural language models have been shown to learn a substantial amount of in-depth knowledge from data [47]. They can do so without any access to an external memory, as a parameterized implicit knowledge base [51, 52]. While this development is exciting, such models do have downsides: They cannot easily expand or revise their memory, can’t straightforwardly provide insight into their predictions, and may produce “hallucinations” [38]. Hybrid models that combine parametric memory with non-parametric (i.e., retrieval-based) memories [20, 26, 48] can address some of these issues because knowledge can be directly revised and expanded, and accessed knowledge can be inspected and interpreted. REALM [20] and ORQA [31], two recently introduced models that combine masked language models [8] with a differentiable retriever, have shown promising results, but have only explored open-domain extractive question answering. Here, we bring hybrid parametric and non-parametric memory to the “workhorse of NLP,” i.e. sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models. \\n\\nWe endow pre-trained, parametric-memory generation models with a non-parametric memory through a general-purpose fine-tuning approach which we refer to as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). We build RAG models where the parametric memory is a pre-trained seq2seq transformer, and the non-parametric memory is a dense vector index of Wikipedia, accessed with a pre-trained neural retriever. We combine these components in a probabilistic model trained end-to-end (Fig. 1). The retriever (Dense Passage Retriever [26], henceforth DPR) provides latent documents conditioned on the input, and the seq2seq model (BART [32]) then conditions on these latent documents together with the input to generate the output. We marginalize the latent documents with a top-K approximation, either on a per-output basis (assuming the same document is responsible for all tokens) or a per-token basis (where different documents are responsible for different tokens). Like T5 [51] or BART, RAG can be fine-tuned on any seq2seq task, whereby both the generator and retriever are jointly learned. \\n\\nThere has been extensive previous work proposing architectures to enrich systems with non-parametric memory which are trained from scratch for specific tasks, e.g. memory networks [64, 55], stackaugmented networks [25] and memory layers [30]. In contrast, we explore a setting where both parametric and non-parametric memory components are pre-trained and pre-loaded with extensive knowledge. Crucially, by using pre-trained access mechanisms, the ability to access knowledge is present without additional training. \\n\\nOur results highlight the benefits of combining parametric and non-parametric memory with generation for knowledge-intensive tasks—tasks that humans could not reasonably be expected to perform without access to an external knowledge source. Our RAG models achieve state-of-the-art results on open Natural Questions [29], WebQuestions [3] and CuratedTrec [2] and strongly outperform recent approaches that use specialised pre-training objectives on TriviaQA [24]. Despite these being extractive tasks, we find that unconstrained generation outperforms previous extractive approaches. For knowledge-intensive generation, we experiment with MS-MARCO [1] and Jeopardy question generation, and we find that our models generate responses that are more factual, specific, and diverse than a BART baseline. For FEVER [56] fact verification, we achieve results within $4 . 3 \\\\%$ of state-of-the-art pipeline models which use strong retrieval supervision. Finally, we demonstrate that the non-parametric memory can be replaced to update the models’ knowledge as the world changes.1 \\n\\n2 Methods \\n\\nWe explore RAG models, which use the input sequence

To assess the effectiveness of the retrieval mechanism, we run ablations where we freeze the retriever during training. As shown in Table 6, learned retrieval improves results for all tasks. \n\nWe compare RAG’s dense retriever to a word overlap-based BM25 retriever [53]. Here, we replace RAG’s retriever with a fixed BM25 system, and use BM25 retrieval scores as logits when calculating $p ( z | x )$ . Table 6 shows the results. For FEVER, BM25 performs best, perhaps since FEVER claims are heavily entity-centric and thus well-suited for word overlap-based retrieval. Differentiable retrieval improves results on all other tasks, especially for Open-Domain QA, where it is crucial. \n\nIndex hot-swapping An advantage of non-parametric memory models like RAG is that knowledge can be easily updated at test time. Parametric-only models like T5 or BART need further training to update their behavior as the world changes. To demonstrate, we build an index using the DrQA [5] Wikipedia dump from December 2016 and compare outputs from RAG using this index to the newer index from our main results (December 2018). We prepare a list of 82 world leaders who had changed between these dates and use a template “Who is {position}?” (e.g. “Who is the President of Peru?”) to query our NQ RAG model with each index. RAG answers $70 \\%$ correctly using the 2016 index for 2016 world leaders and $68 \\%$ using the 2018 index for 2018 world leaders. Accuracy with mismatched indices is low $12 \\%$ with the 2018 index and 2016 leaders, $4 \\%$ with the 2016 index and 2018 leaders). This shows we can update RAG’s world knowledge by simply replacing its non-parametric memory. \n\nEffect of Retrieving more documents Models are trained with either 5 or 10 retrieved latent documents, and we do not observe significant differences in performance between them. We have the flexibility to adjust the number of retrieved documents at test time, which can affect performance and runtime. Figure 3 (left) shows that retrieving more documents at test time monotonically improves Open-domain QA results for RAG-Sequence, but performance peaks for RAG-Token at 10 retrieved documents. Figure 3 (right) shows that retrieving more documents leads to higher Rouge-L for RAG-Token at the expense of Bleu-1, but the effect is less pronounced for RAG-Sequence. \n\n5 Related Work \n\nSingle-Task Retrieval Prior work has shown that retrieval improves performance across a variety of NLP tasks when considered in isolation. Such tasks include open-domain question answering [5, 29], fact checking [56], fact completion [48], long-form question answering [12], Wikipedia article generation [36], dialogue [41, 65, 9, 13], translation [17], and language modeling [19, 27]. Our work unifies previous successes in incorporating retrieval into individual tasks, showing that a single retrieval-based architecture is capable of achieving strong performance across several tasks. \n\nGeneral-Purpose Architectures for NLP Prior work on general-purpose architectures for NLP tasks has shown great success without the use of retrieval. A single, pre-trained language model has been shown to achieve strong performance on various classification tasks in the GLUE benchmarks [60, 61] after fine-tuning [49, 8]. GPT-2 [50] later showed that a single, left-to-right, pre-trained language model could achieve strong performance across both discriminative and generative tasks. For further improvement, BART [32] and T5 [51, 52] propose a single, pre-trained encoder-decoder model that leverages bi-directional attention to achieve stronger performance on discriminative and generative tasks. Our work aims to expand the space of possible tasks with a single, unified architecture, by learning a retrieval module to augment pre-trained, generative language models. \n\nLearned Retrieval There is significant work on learning to retrieve documents in information retrieval, more recently with pre-trained, neural language models [44, 26] similar to ours. Some work optimizes the retrieval module to aid in a specific, downstream task such as question answering, using search [46], reinforcement learning [6, 63, 62], or a latent variable approach [31, 20] as in our work. These successes leverage different retrieval-based architectures and optimization techniques to achieve strong performance on a single task, while we show that a single retrieval-based architecture can be fine-tuned for strong performance on a variety of tasks. \n\nMemory-based Architectures Our document index can be seen as a large external memory for neural networks to attend to, analogous to memory networks [64, 55]. Concurrent work [14] learns to retrieve a trained embedding for each entity in the input, rather than to retrieve raw text as in our work. Other work improves the ability of dialog models to generate factual text by attending over fact embeddings [15, 13]. A key feature of our memory is that it is comprised of raw text rather distributed representations, which makes the memory both (i) human-readable, lending a form of interpretability to our model, and (ii) human-writable, enabling us to dynamically update the model’s memory by editing the document index. This approach has also been used in knowledge-intensive dialog, where generators have been conditioned on retrieved text directly, albeit obtained via TF-IDF rather than end-to-end learnt retrieval [9]. \n\nRetrieve\n\n---Output---\nOutput:",

text rather distributed representations, which makes the memory both (i) human-readable, lending a form of interpretability to our model, and (ii) human-writable, enabling us to dynamically update the model’s memory by editing the document index. This approach has also been used in knowledge-intensive dialog, where generators have been conditioned on retrieved text directly, albeit obtained via TF-IDF rather than end-to-end learnt retrieval [9]. \\n\\nRetrieve-and-Edit approaches Our method shares some similarities with retrieve-and-edit style approaches, where a similar training input-output pair is retrieved for a given input, and then edited to provide a final output. These approaches have proved successful in a number of domains including Machine Translation [18, 22] and Semantic Parsing [21]. Our approach does have several differences, including less of emphasis on lightly editing a retrieved item, but on aggregating content from several pieces of retrieved content, as well as learning latent retrieval, and retrieving evidence documents rather than related training pairs. This said, RAG techniques may work well in these settings, and could represent promising future work. \\n\\n6 Discussion \\n\\nIn this work, we presented hybrid generation models with access to parametric and non-parametric memory. We showed that our RAG models obtain state of the art results on open-domain QA. We found that people prefer RAG’s generation over purely parametric BART, finding RAG more factual and specific. We conducted an thorough investigation of the learned retrieval component, validating its effectiveness, and we illustrated how the retrieval index can be hot-swapped to update the model without requiring any retraining. In future work, it may be fruitful to investigate if the two components can be jointly pre-trained from scratch, either with a denoising objective similar to BART or some another objective. Our work opens up new research directions on how parametric and non-parametric memories interact and how to most effectively combine them, showing promise in being applied to a wide variety of NLP tasks. \\n\\nBroader Impact \\n\\nThis work offers several positive societal benefits over previous work: the fact that it is more strongly grounded in real factual knowledge (in this case Wikipedia) makes it “hallucinate” less with generations that are more factual, and offers more control and interpretability. RAG could be employed in a wide variety of scenarios with direct benefit to society, for example by endowing it with a medical index and asking it open-domain questions on that topic, or by helping people be more effective at their jobs. \\n\\nWith these advantages also come potential downsides: Wikipedia, or any potential external knowledge source, will probably never be entirely factual and completely devoid of bias. Since RAG can be employed as a language model, similar concerns as for GPT-2 [50] are valid here, although arguably to a lesser extent, including that it might be used to generate abuse, faked or misleading content in the news or on social media; to impersonate others; or to automate the production of spam/phishing content [54]. Advanced language models may also lead to the automation of various jobs in the coming decades [16]. In order to mitigate these risks, AI systems could be employed to fight against misleading content and automated spam/phishing. \\n\\nAcknowledgments \\n\\nThe authors would like to thank the reviewers for their thoughtful and constructive feedback on this paper, as well as HuggingFace for their help in open-sourcing code to run RAG models.

generated, which is not possible with standard extractive approaches, leading to more effective marginalization over documents. Furthermore, RAG can generate correct answers even when the correct answer is not in any retrieved document, achieving $1 1 . 8 \\\\%$ accuracy in such cases for NQ, where an extractive model would score $0 \\\\%$ . \\n\\n4.2 Abstractive Question Answering \\n\\nAs shown in Table 2, RAG-Sequence outperforms BART on Open MS-MARCO NLG by 2.6 Bleu points and 2.6 Rouge-L points. RAG approaches state-of-the-art model performance, which is impressive given that (i) those models access gold passages with specific information required to generate the reference answer , (ii) many questions are unanswerable without the gold passages, and (iii) not all questions are answerable from Wikipedia alone. Table 3 shows some generated answers from our models. Qualitatively, we find that RAG models hallucinate less and generate factually correct text more often than BART. Later, we also show that RAG generations are more diverse than BART generations (see $\\\\ S 4 . 5 )$ ). \\n\\n4.3 Jeopardy Question Generation \\n\\nTable 2 shows that RAG-Token performs better than RAG-Sequence on Jeopardy question generation, with both models outperforming BART on Q-BLEU-1. 4 shows human evaluation results, over 452 pairs of generations from BART and RAG-Token. Evaluators indicated that BART was more factual than RAG in only $7 . 1 \\\\%$ of cases, while RAG was more factual in $4 2 . 7 \\\\%$ of cases, and both RAG and BART were factual in a further $17 \\\\%$ of cases, clearly demonstrating the effectiveness of RAG on the task over a state-of-the-art generation model. Evaluators also find RAG generations to be more specific by a large margin. Table 3 shows typical generations from each model. \\n\\nJeopardy questions often contain two separate pieces of information, and RAG-Token may perform best because it can generate responses that combine content from several documents. Figure 2 shows an example. When generating “Sun”, the posterior is high for document 2 which mentions “The Sun Also Rises”. Similarly, document 1 dominates the posterior when “A Farewell to Arms” is generated. Intriguingly, after the first token of each book is generated, the document posterior flattens. This observation suggests that the generator can complete the titles without depending on specific documents. In other words, the model’s parametric knowledge is sufficient to complete the titles. We find evidence for this hypothesis by feeding the BART-only baseline with the partial decoding \\\"The Sun. BART completes the generation \\\"The Sun Also Rises\\\" is a novel by this author of \\\"The Sun Also Rises\\\" indicating the title \\\"The Sun Also Rises\\\" is stored in BART’s parameters. Similarly, BART will complete the partial decoding \\\"The Sun Also Rises\\\" is a novel by this author of \\\"A with \\\"The Sun Also Rises\\\" is a novel by this author of \\\"A Farewell to Arms\\\". This example shows how parametric and non-parametric memories work together—the non-parametric component helps to guide the generation, drawing out specific knowledge stored in the parametric memory. \\n\\n4.4 Fact Verification \\n\\nTable 2 shows our results on FEVER. For 3-way classification, RAG scores are within $4 . 3 \\\\%$ of state-of-the-art models, which are complex pipeline systems with domain-specific architectures and substantial engineering, trained using intermediate retrieval supervision, which RAG does not require. \\n\\nDocument 1: his works are considered classics of American literature ... His wartime experiences formed the basis for his novel ”A Farewell to Arms” (1929) ... \\n\\nDocument 2: ... artists of the 1920s ”Lost Generation” expatriate community. His debut novel, ”The Sun Also Rises”, was published in 1926. \\n\\nFor 2-way classification, we compare against Thorne and Vlachos [57], who train RoBERTa [35] to classify the claim as true or false given the gold evidence sentence. RAG achieves an accuracy within $2 . 7 \\\\%$ of this model, despite being supplied with only the claim and retrieving its own evidence. We also analyze whether documents retrieved by RAG correspond to documents annotated as gold evidence in FEVER. We calculate the overlap in article titles between the top $k$ documents retrieved by RAG and gold evidence annotations. We find that the top retrieved document is from a gold article in $71 \\\\%$ of cases, and a gold article is present in the top 10 retrieved articles in $90 \\\\%$ of cases. \\n\\n4.5 Additional Results \\n\\nGeneration Diversity Section 4.3 shows that RAG models are more factual and specific than BART for Jeopardy question generation. Following recent work on diversity-promoting decoding [33, 59, 39], we also investigate generation diversity by calculating the ratio of distinct ngrams to total ngrams generated by different models. Table 5 shows that RAG-Sequence’s generations are more diverse than RAG-Token’s, and both are significantly more diverse than BART without needing any diversity-promoting decoding. \\n\\nRetrieval Ablations A key feature of RAG is learning to retrieve relevant information for the task. To assess the effectiveness of the retrieval mechanism, we run ablations where we freeze the retriever during training. As shown in Table 6, learned retrieval improves results for all tasks. \\n\\nWe compare RAG’s dense retriever to\\n\\n---Output---\\nOutput:\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"RAG\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"RAG is an advanced model that employs retrieval-augmented generation techniques to enhance question answering and document summarization.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"BART\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"BART is a generative model known for its effectiveness in producing factually accurate responses and question generation.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"FEVER\\\"<|>\\\"event\\\"<|>\\\"FEVER is an evaluation framework that assesses fact verification models through classification tasks using provided claims and evidence.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Jeopardy\\\"<|>\\\"event\\\"<|>\\\"Jeopardy is a quiz show format that often requires the generation of specific questions and answers based on provided information.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"American Literature\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"American Literature refers to the body of written or literary works produced in the United States, which includes classic novels.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Lost Generation\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"The Lost Generation is a term referring to a group of American expatriate writers in the 1920s, known for their disillusionment and creativity.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"A Farewell to Arms\\\"<|>\\\"record\\\"<|>\\\"A Farewell to Arms is a novel published in 1929, known for its portrayal of war and love, based on wartime experiences of its author.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"The Sun Also Rises\\\"<|>\\\"record\\\"<|>\\\"The Sun Also Rises is a novel published in 1926, notable for its depiction of the post-World War I expatriate experience.\\\")##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"RAG\\\"<|>\\\"BART\\\"<|>\\\"RAG outperforms BART in various tasks, indicating a competitive relationship between the two models in the area of question answering and document generation.\\\"<|>\\\"model comparison, performance\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"RAG\\\"<|>\\\"FEVER\\\"<|>\\\"RAG is evaluated using the FEVER framework to assess its effectiveness in fact verification tasks.\\\"<|>\\\"evaluation method, fact verification\\\"<|>7)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"RAG\\\"<|>\\\"Jeopardy\\\"<|>\\\"RAG models are specifically designed to generate questions and answers, making them applicable to generating content in Jeopardy-style formats.\\\"<|>\\\"content generation, quiz format\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"A Farewell to Arms\\\"<|>\\\"American Literature\\\"<|>\\\"A Farewell to Arms is categorized under American Literature as a significant literary work from the U.S.\\\"<|>\\\"literary classification, significant work\\\"<|>10)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"The Sun Also Rises\\\"<|>\\\"Lost Generation\\\"<|>\\\"The Sun Also Rises is associated with the Lost Generation as it reflects the sentiments and experiences of this group of writers.\\\"<|>\\\"cultural reference, literary classification\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"content_keywords\\\"<|>\\\"RAG, BART, question answering, fact verification, American literature, Lost Generation\\\")<|COMPLETE|>\"}]\nMANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

RAG-Token’s, and both are significantly more diverse than BART without needing any diversity-promoting decoding. \\n\\nRetrieval Ablations A key feature of RAG is learning to retrieve relevant information for the task. To assess the effectiveness of the retrieval mechanism, we run ablations where we freeze the retriever during training. As shown in Table 6, learned retrieval improves results for all tasks. \\n\\nWe compare RAG’s dense retriever to a word overlap-based BM25 retriever [53]. Here, we replace RAG’s retriever with a fixed BM25 system, and use BM25 retrieval scores as logits when calculating $p ( z | x )$ . Table 6 shows the results. For FEVER, BM25 performs best, perhaps since FEVER claims are heavily entity-centric and thus well-suited for word overlap-based retrieval. Differentiable retrieval improves results on all other tasks, especially for Open-Domain QA, where it is crucial. \\n\\nIndex hot-swapping An advantage of non-parametric memory models like RAG is that knowledge can be easily updated at test time. Parametric-only models like T5 or BART need further training to update their behavior as the world changes. To demonstrate, we build an index using the DrQA [5] Wikipedia dump from December 2016 and compare outputs from RAG using this index to the newer index from our main results (December 2018). We prepare a list of 82 world leaders who had changed between these dates and use a template “Who is {position}?” (e.g. “Who is the President of Peru?”) to query our NQ RAG model with each index. RAG answers $70 \\\\%$ correctly using the 2016 index for 2016 world leaders and $68 \\\\%$ using the 2018 index for 2018 world leaders. Accuracy with mismatched indices is low $12 \\\\%$ with the 2018 index and 2016 leaders, $4 \\\\%$ with the 2016 index and 2018 leaders). This shows we can update RAG’s world knowledge by simply replacing its non-parametric memory. \\n\\nEffect of Retrieving more documents Models are trained with either 5 or 10 retrieved latent documents, and we do not observe significant differences in performance between them. We have the flexibility to adjust the number of retrieved documents at test time, which can affect performance and runtime. Figure 3 (left) shows that retrieving more documents at test time monotonically improves Open-domain QA results for RAG-Sequence, but performance peaks for RAG-Token at 10 retrieved documents. Figure 3 (right) shows that retrieving more documents leads to higher Rouge-L for RAG-Token at the expense of Bleu-1, but the effect is less pronounced for RAG-Sequence. \\n\\n5 Related Work \\n\\nSingle-Task Retrieval Prior work has shown that retrieval improves performance across a variety of NLP tasks when considered in isolation. Such tasks include open-domain question answering [5, 29], fact checking [56], fact completion [48], long-form question answering [12], Wikipedia article generation [36], dialogue [41, 65, 9, 13], translation [17], and language modeling [19, 27]. Our work unifies previous successes in incorporating retrieval into individual tasks, showing that a single retrieval-based architecture is capable of achieving strong performance across several tasks. \\n\\nGeneral-Purpose Architectures for NLP Prior work on general-purpose architectures for NLP tasks has shown great success without the use of retrieval. A single, pre-trained language model has been shown to achieve strong performance on various classification tasks in the GLUE benchmarks [60, 61] after fine-tuning [49, 8]. GPT-2 [50] later showed that a single, left-to-right, pre-trained language model could achieve strong performance across both discriminative and generative tasks. For further improvement, BART [32] and T5 [51, 52] propose a single, pre-trained encoder-decoder model that leverages bi-directional attention to achieve stronger performance on discriminative and generative tasks. Our work aims to expand the space of possible tasks with a single, unified architecture, by learning a retrieval module to augment pre-trained, generative language models. \\n\\nLearned Retrieval There is significant work on learning to retrieve documents in information retrieval, more recently with pre-trained, neural language models [44, 26] similar to ours. Some work optimizes the retrieval module to aid in a specific, downstream task such as question answering, using search [46], reinforcement learning [6, 63, 62], or a latent variable approach [31, 20] as in our work. These successes leverage different retrieval-based architectures and optimization techniques to achieve strong performance on a single task, while we show that a single retrieval-based architecture can be fine-tuned for strong performance on a variety of tasks. \\n\\nMemory-based Architectures Our document index can be seen as a large external memory for neural networks to attend to, analogous to memory networks [64, 55]. Concurrent work [14] learns to retrieve a trained embedding for each entity in the input, rather than to retrieve raw text as in our work. Other work improves the ability of dialog models to generate factual text by attending over fact embeddings [15, 13]. A key feature of our memory is that it is comprised of raw text rather distributed representations, which makes the memory both (i) human-readable, lending a form of interpretability to our model, and (ii) human-writable, enabling us to dynamically update the model’s memory by editing the document index. This approach has also been used in knowledge-intensive dialog, where generators have been conditioned on retrieved text directly, albeit obtained via TF-IDF rather than end-to-end learnt retrieval [9]. \\n\\nRetrieve\\n\\n---Output---\\nOutput:\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"AG-Sequence\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"AG-Sequence is an organization known for its diverse generations compared to other models, particularly RAG-Token and BART.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"RAG-Token\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"RAG-Token is a model whose generations are less diverse than AG-Sequence's, indicating differences in their decoding mechanisms.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"BART\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"BART is a model referenced for lower diversity in its generations and requiring diversity-promoting decoding.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"RAG\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"RAG is identified as a model that effectively learns to retrieve relevant information for various NLP tasks.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"DrQA\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"DrQA is referenced in relation to building indexes from Wikipedia dumps for retrieval tasks.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Open-Domain QA\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Open-Domain QA is a category of tasks where retrieval mechanisms are crucial for performance improvements.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"FEVER\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"FEVER is a task focused on entity-centric claims that benefit significantly from word overlap-based retrieval.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"GLUE benchmarks\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"GLUE benchmarks are a set of standard tasks for evaluating the performance of language models.\\\")##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"AG-Sequence\\\"<|>\\\"RAG-Token\\\"<|>\\\"AG-Sequence's generations are more diverse than RAG-Token's, pointing to differences in their performance and decoding processes.\\\"<|>\\\"diversity comparison, performance metrics\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"AG-Sequence\\\"<|>\\\"BART\\\"<|>\\\"AG-Sequence is asserted to be more diverse than BART, which relies on diversity-promoting decoding methods.\\\"<|>\\\"diversity comparison, decoding method\\\"<|>7)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"RAG\\\"<|>\\\"RAG-Token\\\"<|>\\\"RAG's retrieval mechanism aims to enhance results in tasks where RAG-Token is involved, showing a relationship in model improvement.\\\"<|>\\\"model improvement, retrieval mechanism\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"DrQA\\\"<|>\\\"RAG\\\"<|>\\\"DrQA is used as a foundation for RAG to build an index for efficient retrieval from Wikipedia, indicating a collaborative function.\\\"<|>\\\"index building, retrieval collaboration\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Open-Domain QA\\\"<|>\\\"RAG\\\"<|>\\\"RAG's retrieval capabilities are crucial for improving outcomes in Open-Domain QA tasks, showcasing a direct application of the model.\\\"<|>\\\"task performance, retrieval application\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"FEVER\\\"<|>\\\"RAG\\\"<|>\\\"The performance benefits seen in FEVER claims are indicative of RAG's capability to enhance retrieval tasks.\\\"<|>\\\"performance enhancement, task relationship\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"GLUE benchmarks\\\"<|>\\\"BART\\\"<|>\\\"BART is noted for achieving strong results across tasks in the GLUE benchmarks, indicating its effectiveness as a language model.\\\"<|>\\\"performance evaluation, task effectiveness\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"content_keywords\\\"<|>\\\"diversity in models, retrieval mechanisms, NLP tasks, performance enhancement\\\")<|COMPLETE|>\"}]\nMANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

For RAG-Sequence models, we report test results using 50 retrieved documents, and we use the Thorough Decoding approach since answers are generally short. We use greedy decoding for QA as we did not find beam search improved results. For Open-MSMarco and Jeopardy question generation, we report test numbers using ten retrieved documents for both RAG-Token and RAG-Sequence, and we also train a BART-large model as a baseline. We use a beam size of four, and use the Fast Decoding approach for RAG-Sequence models, as Thorough Decoding did not improve performance. \n\nB Human Evaluation \n\nFigure 4 shows the user interface for human evaluation. To avoid any biases for screen position, which model corresponded to sentence A and sentence B was randomly selected for each example. Annotators were encouraged to research the topic using the internet, and were given detailed instructions and worked examples in a full instructions tab. We included some gold sentences in order to assess the accuracy of the annotators. Two annotators did not perform well on these examples and their annotations were removed from the results. \n\nC Training setup Details \n\nWe train all RAG models and BART baselines using Fairseq [45].2 We train with mixed precision floating point arithmetic [40], distributing training across 8, 32GB NVIDIA V100 GPUs, though training and inference can be run on one GPU. We find that doing Maximum Inner Product Search with FAISS is sufficiently fast on CPU, so we store document index vectors on\n\n---Output---\nOutput:",

Jordan looked up, and for a fleeting heartbeat, their eyes locked with Taylor's, a wordless clash of wills softening into an uneasy truce.\n\nIt was a small transformation, barely perceptible, but one that Alex noted with an inward nod.

Analysts attribute the selloff to investor concerns over rising interest rates and regulatory uncertainty.\n\nAmong the hardest hit, Nexon Technologies saw its stock plummet by 7.8% after reporting lower-than-expected quarterly earnings. In contrast, Omega Energy posted a modest 2.1% gain, driven by rising oil prices.\n\nMeanwhile, commodity markets reflected a mixed sentiment.

We find that doing Maximum Inner Product Search with FAISS is sufficiently fast on CPU, so we store document index vectors on CPU, requiring $\\sim 1 0 0$ GB of CPU memory for all of Wikipedia. After submission, We have ported our code to HuggingFace Transformers $[ 6 6 ] ^ { 3 }$ , which achieves equivalent performance to the previous version but is a cleaner and easier to use implementation. This version is also open-sourced. We also compress the document index using FAISS’s compression tools, reducing the CPU memory requirement to 36GB. Scripts to run experiments with RAG can be found at https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/ blob/master/examples/rag/README.md and an interactive demo of a RAG model can be found at https://huggingface.co/rag/ \n\nD Further Details on Open-Domain QA \n\nFor open-domain QA, multiple answer annotations are often available for a given question. These answer annotations are exploited by extractive models during training as typically all the answer annotations are used to find matches within documents when preparing training data. For RAG, we also make use of multiple annotation examples for Natural Questions and WebQuestions by training the model with each $( q , a )$ pair separately, leading to a small increase in accuracy. For TriviaQA, there are often many valid answers to a given question, some of which are not suitable training targets, such as emoji or spelling variants. For TriviaQA, we filter out answer candidates if they do not occur in top 1000 documents for the query. \n\nCuratedTrec preprocessing The answers for CuratedTrec are given in the form of regular expressions, which has been suggested as a reason why it is unsuitable for answer-generation models [20]. To overcome this, we use a pre-processing step where we first retrieve the top 1000 documents for each query, and use the answer that most frequently matches the regex pattern as the supervision target. If no matches are found, we resort to a simple heuristic: generate all possible permutations for each regex, replacing non-deterministic symbols in the regex nested tree structure with a whitespace. \n\nTriviaQA Evaluation setups The open-domain QA community customarily uses public development datasets as test datasets, as test data for QA datasets is often restricted and dedicated to reading compehension purposes. We report our results using the datasets splits used in DPR [26], which are consistent with common practice in Open-domain QA. For TriviaQA, this test dataset is the public TriviaQA Web Development split. Roberts et al. [52] used the TriviaQA official Wikipedia test set instead. Févry et al. [14] follow this convention in order to compare with Roberts et al. [52] (See appendix of [14]). We report results on both test sets to enable fair comparison to both approaches. We find that our performance is much higher using the official Wiki test set, rather than the more conventional open-domain test set, which we attribute to the official Wiki test set questions being simpler to answer from Wikipedia. \n\nE Further Details on FEVER \n\nFor FEVER classification, we follow the practice from [32], and first re-generate the claim, and then classify using the representation of the final hidden state, before finally marginalizing across documents to obtain the class probabilities. The FEVER task traditionally has two sub-tasks. The first is to classify the claim as either \"Supported\", \"Refuted\" or \"Not Enough Info\", which is the task we explore in the main paper. FEVER’s other sub-task involves extracting sentences from Wikipedia as evidence supporting the classification prediction. As FEVER uses a different Wikipedia dump to us, directly tackling this task is not straightforward. We hope to address this in future work. \n\nF Null Document Probabilities \n\nWe experimented with adding \"Null document\" mechanism to RAG, similar to REALM [20] in order to model cases where no useful information could be retrieved for a given input. Here, if $k$ documents were retrieved, we would additionally \"retrieve\" an empty document and predict a logit for the null document, before marginalizing over $k + 1$ predictions. We explored modelling this null document logit by learning (i) a document embedding for the null document, (ii) a static learnt bias term, or (iii) a neural network to predict the logit. We did not find that these improved performance, so in the interests of simplicity, we omit them. For Open MS-MARCO, where useful retrieved documents cannot always be retrieved, we observe that the model learns to always retrieve a particular set of documents for questions that are less likely to benefit from retrieval, suggesting that null document mechanisms may not be necessary for RAG. \n\nG Parameters \n\nOur RAG models contain the trainable parameters for the BERT-base query and document encoder of DPR, with 110M parameters each (although we do not train the document encoder ourselves) and 406M trainable parameters from BART-large, 406M parameters, making a total of 626M trainable parameters. The best performing \"closed-book\" (parametric only) open-domain QA model is T5-11B with 11 Billion trainable parameters. The T5 model with the closest number of parameters to our models is T5-large (770M parameters), which achieves a score of $2 8 . 9 \\mathrm { E M }$ on Natural Questions [52], substantially below the\n\n---Output---\nOutput:",

For RAG-Sequence models, we report test results using 50 retrieved documents, and we use the Thorough Decoding approach since answers are generally short. We use greedy decoding for QA as we did not find beam search improved results. For Open-MSMarco and Jeopardy question generation, we report test numbers using ten retrieved documents for both RAG-Token and RAG-Sequence, and we also train a BART-large model as a baseline. We use a beam size of four, and use the Fast Decoding approach for RAG-Sequence models, as Thorough Decoding did not improve performance. \\n\\nB Human Evaluation \\n\\nFigure 4 shows the user interface for human evaluation. To avoid any biases for screen position, which model corresponded to sentence A and sentence B was randomly selected for each example. Annotators were encouraged to research the topic using the internet, and were given detailed instructions and worked examples in a full instructions tab. We included some gold sentences in order to assess the accuracy of the annotators. Two annotators did not perform well on these examples and their annotations were removed from the results. \\n\\nC Training setup Details \\n\\nWe train all RAG models and BART baselines using Fairseq [45].2 We train with mixed precision floating point arithmetic [40], distributing training across 8, 32GB NVIDIA V100 GPUs, though training and inference can be run on one GPU. We find that doing Maximum Inner Product Search with FAISS is sufficiently fast on CPU, so we store document index vectors on\\n\\n---Output---\\nOutput:\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\":

annotations were removed from the results. \\n\\nC Training setup Details \\n\\nWe train all RAG models and BART baselines using Fairseq [45].2 We train with mixed precision floating point arithmetic [40], distributing training across 8, 32GB NVIDIA V100 GPUs, though training and inference can be run on one GPU. We find that doing Maximum Inner Product Search with FAISS is sufficiently fast on CPU, so we store document index vectors on CPU, requiring $\\\\sim 1 0 0$ GB of CPU memory for all of Wikipedia. After submission, We have ported our code to HuggingFace Transformers $[ 6 6 ] ^ { 3 }$ , which achieves equivalent performance to the previous version but is a cleaner and easier to use implementation. This version is also open-sourced. We also compress the document index using FAISS’s compression tools, reducing the CPU memory requirement to 36GB. Scripts to run experiments with RAG can be found at https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/ blob/master/examples/rag/README.md and an interactive demo of a RAG model can be found at https://huggingface.co/rag/ \\n\\nD Further Details on Open-Domain QA \\n\\nFor open-domain QA, multiple answer annotations are often available for a given question. These answer annotations are exploited by extractive models during training as typically all the answer annotations are used to find matches within documents when preparing training data. For RAG, we also make use of multiple annotation examples for Natural Questions and WebQuestions by training the model with each $( q , a )$ pair separately, leading to a small increase in accuracy. For TriviaQA, there are often many valid answers to a given question, some of which are not suitable training targets, such as emoji or spelling variants. For TriviaQA, we filter out answer candidates if they do not occur in top 1000 documents for the query. \\n\\nCuratedTrec preprocessing The answers for CuratedTrec are given in the form of regular expressions, which has been suggested as a reason why it is unsuitable for answer-generation models [20]. To overcome this, we use a pre-processing step where we first retrieve the top 1000 documents for each query, and use the answer that most frequently matches the regex pattern as the supervision target. If no matches are found, we resort to a simple heuristic: generate all possible permutations for each regex, replacing non-deterministic symbols in the regex nested tree structure with a whitespace. \\n\\nTriviaQA Evaluation setups The open-domain QA community customarily uses public development datasets as test datasets, as test data for QA datasets is often restricted and dedicated to reading compehension purposes. We report our results using the datasets splits used in DPR [26], which are consistent with common practice in Open-domain QA. For TriviaQA, this test dataset is the public TriviaQA Web Development split. Roberts et al. [52] used the TriviaQA official Wikipedia test set instead. Févry et al. [14] follow this convention in order to compare with Roberts et al. [52] (See appendix of [14]). We report results on both test sets to enable fair comparison to both approaches. We find that our performance is much higher using the official Wiki test set, rather than the more conventional open-domain test set, which we attribute to the official Wiki test set questions being simpler to answer from Wikipedia. \\n\\nE Further Details on FEVER \\n\\nFor FEVER classification, we follow the practice from [32], and first re-generate the claim, and then classify using the representation of the final hidden state, before finally marginalizing across documents to obtain the class probabilities. The FEVER task traditionally has two sub-tasks. The first is to classify the claim as either \\\"Supported\\\", \\\"Refuted\\\" or \\\"Not Enough Info\\\", which is the task we explore in the main paper. FEVER’s other sub-task involves extracting sentences from Wikipedia as evidence supporting the classification prediction. As FEVER uses a different Wikipedia dump to us, directly tackling this task is not straightforward. We hope to address this in future work. \\n\\nF Null Document Probabilities \\n\\nWe experimented with adding \\\"Null document\\\" mechanism to RAG, similar to REALM [20] in order to model cases where no useful information could be retrieved for a given input. Here, if $k$ documents were retrieved, we would additionally \\\"retrieve\\\" an empty document and predict a logit for the null document, before marginalizing over $k + 1$ predictions. We explored modelling this null document logit by learning (i) a document embedding for the null document, (ii) a static learnt bias term, or (iii) a neural network to predict the logit. We did not find that these improved performance, so in the interests of simplicity, we omit them. For Open MS-MARCO, where useful retrieved documents cannot always be retrieved, we observe that the model learns to always retrieve a particular set of documents for questions that are less likely to benefit from retrieval, suggesting that null document mechanisms may not be necessary for RAG. \\n\\nG Parameters \\n\\nOur RAG models contain the trainable parameters for the BERT-base query and document encoder of DPR, with 110M parameters each (although we do not train the document encoder ourselves) and 406M trainable parameters from BART-large, 406M parameters, making a total of 626M trainable parameters. The best performing \\\"closed-book\\\" (parametric only) open-domain QA model is T5-11B with 11 Billion trainable parameters. The T5 model with the closest number of parameters to our models is T5-large (770M parameters), which achieves a score of $2 8 . 9 \\\\mathrm { E M }$ on Natural Questions [52], substantially below the\\n\\n---Output---\\nOutput:\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Fairseq\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"Fairseq is a framework used for training various models, including RAG and BART, and is associated with mixed precision floating-point arithmetic.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"RAG\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) models are designed for training with mixed precision and utilize document indexing for various QA tasks.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"HuggingFace Transformers\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"HuggingFace Transformers is an open-source platform that provides implementations for various machine learning models, including RAG.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Wiki Test Set\\\"<|>\\\"event\\\"<|>\\\"The Wiki Test Set is a specific dataset used for evaluating performance on question-answering tasks, noted for being simpler to answer from Wikipedia.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"CuratedTrec\\\"<|>\\\"event\\\"<|>\\\"CuratedTrec involves processing answer annotations in the form of regular expressions for use in answer-generation models.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"TriviaQA\\\"<|>\\\"event\\\"<|>\\\"TriviaQA is an open-domain QA dataset that provides a framework for evaluating question-answering models with public development datasets.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"FEVER\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"FEVER (Fact Extraction and Verification) is a classification task designed to determine the support status of given claims.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Natural Questions\\\"<|>\\\"event\\\"<|>\\\"Natural Questions is another QA dataset that aids in measuring the accuracy of retrieval-augmented models like RAG.\\\")##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Fairseq\\\"<|>\\\"HuggingFace Transformers\\\"<|>\\\"Fairseq has been ported to HuggingFace Transformers to achieve similar performance but with an easier-to-use implementation.\\\"<|>\\\"model implementation, open source\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"TriviaQA\\\"<|>\\\"Natural Questions\\\"<|>\\\"Both TriviaQA and Natural Questions are datasets used for training and evaluating open-domain QA models.\\\"<|>\\\"data evaluation, QA training\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"CuratedTrec\\\"<|>\\\"TriviaQA\\\"<|>\\\"CuratedTrec and TriviaQA involve similar processes for handling answer annotations for question-answering tasks.\\\"<|>\\\"data processing, annotation \\\"<|>7)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"FEVER\\\"<|>\\\"RAG\\\"<|>\\\"The FEVER task is one of the areas RAG models are applied for, focusing on classification based on evidence extraction.\\\"<|>\\\"task application, evidence-based classification\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"content_keywords\\\"<|>\\\"open-domain QA, model training, datasets, classification, evaluation\\\")<|COMPLETE|>\"}]\nMANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

1 } )$$ formulates a probabilistic model for generating a sequence of tokens \\( y \\) conditioned on an input sequence \\( x \\), where the generation process is augmented by retrieval of relevant documents \\( z \\). This model operates under the framework of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), integrating two types of memory: parametric (modeled by a seq2seq generator) and non-parametric (encoded in a document index). The term \\( p_{\\eta}(z | x) \\) represents the probability distribution over retrieved documents given the input, while \\( p_{\\theta}(y_i | x, z, y_{1:i-1}) \\) is the conditional probability of generating the token \\( y_i \\) based on the previous tokens and the input context. The use of the product and sum in the equation captures the dependencies across different tokens while marginalizing over the retrieved documents. This equation operationalizes the RAG framework in tasks requiring knowledge retrieval and generation, emphasizing the parallel integration of generative and retrieval-based methodologies. It also indicates flexibility in document selection per target token, allowing for diverse and factual generation based on varying contexts. In the context of computational linguistics, this equation represents a sophisticated approach to combining pre-trained models with retrieval mechanisms to enhance the performance of tasks such as question answering, summarization, and fact verification. The probabilistic interpretation links to concepts of Bayesian inference and helps illustrate how uncertainty is modeled in the generative process. This model's practical applications include open-domain question answering and competitive performance in standardized knowledge-intensive benchmarks, reinforcing the vitality of accessing augmented information sources.\n\n---Output---\nOutput:",

for generating a sequence of tokens \\\\( y \\\\) conditioned on an input sequence \\\\( x \\\\), where the generation process is augmented by retrieval of relevant documents \\\\( z \\\\). This model operates under the framework of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), integrating two types of memory: parametric (modeled by a seq2seq generator) and non-parametric (encoded in a document index). The term \\\\( p_{\\\\eta}(z | x) \\\\) represents the probability distribution over retrieved documents given the input, while \\\\( p_{\\\\theta}(y_i | x, z, y_{1:i-1}) \\\\) is the conditional probability of generating the token \\\\( y_i \\\\) based on the previous tokens and the input context. The use of the product and sum in the equation captures the dependencies across different tokens while marginalizing over the retrieved documents. This equation operationalizes the RAG framework in tasks requiring knowledge retrieval and generation, emphasizing the parallel integration of generative and retrieval-based methodologies. It also indicates flexibility in document selection per target token, allowing for diverse and factual generation based on varying contexts. In the context of computational linguistics, this equation represents a sophisticated approach to combining pre-trained models with retrieval mechanisms to enhance the performance of tasks such as question answering, summarization, and fact verification. The probabilistic interpretation links to concepts of Bayesian inference and helps illustrate how uncertainty is modeled in the generative process.

Here, $\\\\mathbf{d}(z)$ and $\\\\mathbf{q}(x)$ are dense vector representations of the document $z$ and input query $x$, respectively, obtained through the BERT model. The exponential function indicates a probabilistic relationship where documents closer in the latent space (higher inner product) yield higher retrieval likelihoods. The formulation uses maximum inner product search (MIPS) methodology to efficiently retrieve the top-K documents, crucial in large-scale document indexing applications. The function $p_{\\\\eta}(z|x)$ integrates both parametric and non-parametric memory components in the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model.

The structure comprises four columns detailing the model names and their corresponding scores across different metrics: NQ, TQA, WQ, and CT. Key data points illustrate that both RAG-Token and RAG-Sequence achieve the highest scores in nearly all categories, particularly excelling in the NQ score (44.1 and 44.5 respectively), indicating their strengths in generative capabilities while effectively utilizing retrieval techniques. Notably, RAG shows superior performance without the need for sophisticated preprocessing of inputs such as salient span masking. Statistical insights reflect a consistent trend of RAG models outperforming closed-book systems (like standard T5) and synthetic approaches (like REALM) in open-book tasks, suggesting a compelling fusion of knowledge generation and retrieval. The relationships between the model types clarify how RAG leverages both parametric knowledge (like that in T5) and external document retrieval (shown in REALM and DPR), enhancing performance on complex QA tasks. Additionally, the surrounding context emphasizes the challenges of traditional QA systems, justifying RAG's innovative approaches that capitalize on knowledge that may not be captured in isolated passages. This table, therefore, supports the narrative that RAG not only improves factual accuracy but also increases the ability to generate correct answers through marginalization of information across potentially multiple documents.\n\n---Output---\nOutput:",

It is structured in a multi-level format, with the first row defining model names and benchmark metrics categorized by Jeopardy and MS-MARCO performance. The column headers signify different performance metrics - B-1 represents the BLEU-1 score relevant for question generation, while R-L and Label Accuracy pertain to other quantitative evaluations. Key data points include RAG-Token achieving a BLEU-1 score of 17.3 on Jeopardy, outperforming the baseline model BART (15.1), indicating RAG-Token's superiority in generating natural language questions. The trends show that models relying on retrieval mechanisms (RAG-Sequence) consistently outperform traditional ones (BART) across diverse tasks, suggesting the benefit of parametric knowledge in generating factual and contextually rich outputs. The relationships reveal that advancements in question generation systems could potentially improve QA tasks dramatically, which align with the exploration of RAG's capabilities in open-domain tasks described in the surrounding content. RAG's performance seems particularly remarkable given its lack of reliance on gold passages, emphasizing its ability to synthesize information effectively and adaptively from broader data, reinforcing the principles outlined on effective QA methodologies in the previous segments.\n\n---Output---\nOutput:",

The overall layout is a rectangular matrix with rows labeled as Doc 1 through Doc 5 on the vertical axis, representing different documents. The horizontal axis is divided into columns, each labeled with parts of sentences or tokens: 'BOS', 'The', 'Sun', 'Also', 'R', 'ises', 'is', 'a', 'novel', 'by', 'this', 'author', 'of', 'A', 'Fare', 'well', 'to', 'Arms'. The background color of the matrix is light blue, with varying intensities indicating the weight or importance of each token in each document context. Darker blue signifies higher importance or relevance. Notably, the tokens 'The Sun Also Rises' show increased intensity in Doc 2, while 'A Farewell to Arms' is more prominent in Doc 1. This relationship suggests that the model might leverage these specific documents when constructing sentences or when confronted with related queries as described in the surrounding document context. The heatmap underscores how the RAG model utilizes parametric knowledge stored in different document contexts to aid in sentence completion or answer generation, as discussed in the surrounding research context emphasizing parametric and non-parametric memory in language models.\n\n---Output---\nOutput:",

The structure consists of four main columns: 'Task', 'Input', 'Model', and 'Generation'. The 'Task' column indicates the type of query (e.g., MS-MARCO, Jeopardy Question, etc.), while 'Input' contains the specific questions posed to the models. The 'Model' column lists the models utilized to generate answers, and 'Generation' shows the actual product or output from the models. Notably, the table reveals that RAG models consistently provide more accurate and specific responses than BART, illustrated by examples where RAG-Sequence answers comprehensively compared to BART’s uncertain or partially correct outputs (e.g., '?' and '*' markers). Statistically, RAG outperforms BART in factual accuracy, as indicated in the surrounding sections, highlighting the significance of retrieval-augmented generation in producing reliable outputs. The relations among tasks, inputs, and model performances illustrate how RAG's enhanced ability to combine contextual knowledge from multiple sources leads to improved answer quality. This supports the broader claim in the surrounding content that RAG models excel in generating more robust and factual text, crucial for applications like Q&A systems and evaluation metrics.\n\n---Output---\nOutput:",

It is structured in a multi-level format, with the first row defining model names and benchmark metrics categorized by Jeopardy and MS-MARCO performance. The column headers signify different performance metrics - B-1 represents the BLEU-1 score relevant for question generation, while R-L and Label Accuracy pertain to other quantitative evaluations. Key data points include RAG-Token achieving a BLEU-1 score of 17.3 on Jeopardy, outperforming the baseline model BART (15.1), indicating RAG-Token's superiority in generating natural language questions. The trends show that models relying on retrieval mechanisms (RAG-Sequence) consistently outperform traditional ones (BART) across diverse tasks, suggesting the benefit of parametric knowledge in generating factual and contextually rich outputs. The relationships reveal that advancements in question generation systems could potentially improve QA tasks dramatically, which align with the exploration of RAG's capabilities in open-domain tasks described in the surrounding content. RAG's performance seems particularly remarkable given its lack of reliance on gold passages, emphasizing its ability to synthesize information effectively and adaptively from broader data, reinforcing the principles outlined on effective QA methodologies in the previous segments.\\n\\n---Output---\\nOutput:\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"RAG-Token\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"RAG-Token is a model that achieves a BLEU-1 score of 17.3 on Jeopardy question generation, outperforming the baseline model BART.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"BART\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"BART is a baseline model for question generation which achieved a BLEU-1 score of 15.1, indicating a lower performance compared to RAG-Token.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Jeopardy\\\"<|>\\\"event\\\"<|>\\\"Jeopardy refers to a question generation task where various models are evaluated based on their performance in generating questions.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"MS-MARCO\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"MS-MARCO is a benchmark task used to evaluate the performance of models in generating relevant responses based on queries.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"FEVER\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"FEVER is a set of tasks focused on fact verification, assessed through models' performance.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"RAG-Sequence\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"RAG-Sequence is a retrieval-based model that shows consistent performance improvement over traditional models across diverse tasks.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Question Generation Systems\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Question Generation Systems involve methodologies aimed at creating questions from content, significantly impacting QA task performances.\\\")##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"RAG-Token\\\"<|>\\\"BART\\\"<|>\\\"RAG-Token outperforms BART on Jeopardy in terms of question generation accuracy, indicating a direct comparison between the two models.\\\"<|>\\\"model performance, benchmark comparison\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"RAG-Sequence\\\"<|>\\\"RAG-Token\\\"<|>\\\"RAG-Sequence demonstrates a trend of outperforming traditional models like RAG-Token in question generation tasks.\\\"<|>\\\"model performance, retrieval advantage\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Jeopardy\\\"<|>\\\"MS-MARCO\\\"<|>\\\"Both Jeopardy and MS-MARCO are benchmark tasks that assess models in their ability to generate relevant outputs based on provided queries.\\\"<|>\\\"benchmark tasks, performance evaluation\\\"<|>7)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Question Generation Systems\\\"<|>\\\"Jeopardy\\\"<|>\\\"Advancements in Question Generation Systems are linked to their performance in Jeopardy, influencing the effectiveness of QA tasks.\\\"<|>\\\"QA methodologies, performance enhancement\\\"<|>6)##\\n(\\\"content_keywords\\\"<|>\\\"question generation, model evaluation, performance metrics, QA tasks, retrieval mechanisms\\\")<|COMPLETE|>\"}]\nMANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

The structure comprises four columns detailing the model names and their corresponding scores across different metrics: NQ, TQA, WQ, and CT. Key data points illustrate that both RAG-Token and RAG-Sequence achieve the highest scores in nearly all categories, particularly excelling in the NQ score (44.1 and 44.5 respectively), indicating their strengths in generative capabilities while effectively utilizing retrieval techniques. Notably, RAG shows superior performance without the need for sophisticated preprocessing of inputs such as salient span masking. Statistical insights reflect a consistent trend of RAG models outperforming closed-book systems (like standard T5) and synthetic approaches (like REALM) in open-book tasks, suggesting a compelling fusion of knowledge generation and retrieval. The relationships between the model types clarify how RAG leverages both parametric knowledge (like that in T5) and external document retrieval (shown in REALM and DPR), enhancing performance on complex QA tasks. Additionally, the surrounding context emphasizes the challenges of traditional QA systems, justifying RAG's innovative approaches that capitalize on knowledge that may not be captured in isolated passages. This table, therefore, supports the narrative that RAG not only improves factual accuracy but also increases the ability to generate correct answers through marginalization of information across potentially multiple documents.\\n\\n---Output---\\nOutput:\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"RAG-Token\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"RAG-Token is a retrieval-augmented generation model that achieved high scores in open-domain QA tasks, particularly excelling in the NQ score of 44.1.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"RAG-Sequence\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"RAG-Sequence is another retrieval-augmented generation model known for achieving a score of 44.5 in the NQ metric, indicative of its strong performance in generative capabilities with retrieval.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"T5\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"T5 is a standard closed-book model in the context of open-domain question answering, serving as a benchmark for comparative analysis against newer models like RAG.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"REALM\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"REALM is a synthetic model that utilizes external document retrieval, showing competitive performance in QA tasks but is outperformed by RAG models.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"DPR\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"DPR is another model focusing on retrieval-augmented approaches within open-domain QA, providing comparative insights against RAG models.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Open-Domain QA Tasks\\\"<|>\\\"event\\\"<|>\\\"Open-Domain QA Tasks refer to the evaluation scenarios in which various models, including T5, RAG, REALM, and DPR, are assessed on their ability to answer questions using a broad range of knowledge.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Table 1: Open-Domain QA Test Scores\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Table 1 presents scores from different models in open-domain QA, highlighting their performance across various metrics and providing a structured comparison.\\\")##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"RAG-Token\\\"<|>\\\"Open-Domain QA Tasks\\\"<|>\\\"RAG-Token's performance is assessed within the framework of Open-Domain QA Tasks, where it excels in scoring, particularly in the NQ metric.\\\"<|>\\\"model assessment, performance evaluation\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"RAG-Sequence\\\"<|>\\\"Open-Domain QA Tasks\\\"<|>\\\"RAG-Sequence is analyzed in the context of Open-Domain QA Tasks, achieving high scores that highlight its effectiveness in generative capabilities.\\\"<|>\\\"model assessment, performance evaluation\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"T5\\\"<|>\\\"Open-Domain QA Tasks\\\"<|>\\\"T5 serves as a benchmark model within Open-Domain QA Tasks, allowing for performance comparison against newer models like RAG.\\\"<|>\\\"model benchmark, comparative analysis\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"REALM\\\"<|>\\\"Open-Domain QA Tasks\\\"<|>\\\"REALM's performance is evaluated in Open-Domain QA Tasks, demonstrating strengths in retrieval techniques compared to RAG models.\\\"<|>\\\"model assessment, performance evaluation\\\"<|>7)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"DPR\\\"<|>\\\"Open-Domain QA Tasks\\\"<|>\\\"DPR is compared within Open-Domain QA Tasks, revealing its capabilities in retrieval-augmented QA against RAG models.\\\"<|>\\\"model assessment, performance evaluation\\\"<|>7)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"RAG-Token\\\"<|>\\\"RAG-Sequence\\\"<|>\\\"Both RAG-Token and RAG-Sequence are retrieval-augmented generation models that achieved top scores in the same open-domain QA tasks, indicating their related methodologies.\\\"<|>\\\"model comparison, performance synergy\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"content_keywords\\\"<|>\\\"retrieval-augmented generation, open-domain QA, performance comparison, models analysis, question answering\\\")<|COMPLETE|>\"}]\nMANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

The structure consists of four main columns: 'Task', 'Input', 'Model', and 'Generation'. The 'Task' column indicates the type of query (e.g., MS-MARCO, Jeopardy Question, etc.), while 'Input' contains the specific questions posed to the models. The 'Model' column lists the models utilized to generate answers, and 'Generation' shows the actual product or output from the models. Notably, the table reveals that RAG models consistently provide more accurate and specific responses than BART, illustrated by examples where RAG-Sequence answers comprehensively compared to BART’s uncertain or partially correct outputs (e.g., '?' and '*' markers). Statistically, RAG outperforms BART in factual accuracy, as indicated in the surrounding sections, highlighting the significance of retrieval-augmented generation in producing reliable outputs. The relations among tasks, inputs, and model performances illustrate how RAG's enhanced ability to combine contextual knowledge from multiple sources leads to improved answer quality. This supports the broader claim in the surrounding content that RAG models excel in generating more robust and factual text, crucial for applications like Q&A systems and evaluation metrics.\\n\\n---Output---\\nOutput:\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"RAG Models\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"RAG Models, including RAG-Token and RAG-Sequence, are retrieval-augmented generation models that provide answers to various tasks, demonstrating greater accuracy than other models.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"BART\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"BART is a model used for comparison against RAG models in generating answers, often resulting in uncertain or partially correct outputs.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"MS-MARCO\\\"<|>\\\"event\\\"<|>\\\"MS-MARCO is one of the task types referenced in the table, involving definitions and information retrieval related to questions posed.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Jeopardy Question\\\"<|>\\\"event\\\"<|>\\\"Jeopardy Question refers to a type of inquiry included in the comparison of various models' responses.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Scotland\\\"<|>\\\"geo\\\"<|>\\\"Scotland is mentioned in the context of queries related to currency needed in the region, indicating its relevance in the task examples.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Middle Ear\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"The middle ear is a category under anatomical structures that is defined in relation to questions posed to the models.\\\")##\\n(\\\"content_keywords\\\"<|>\\\"RAG models, BART, comparative analysis, task examples, model evaluation\\\")##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"RAG Models\\\"<|>\\\"BART\\\"<|>\\\"RAG Models are compared against BART to assess the accuracy and specificity of their generated responses.\\\"<|>\\\"model comparison, performance evaluation\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"MS-MARCO\\\"<|>\\\"RAG Models\\\"<|>\\\"RAG Models provide answers to tasks like MS-MARCO, showing their effectiveness in generating accurate content.\\\"<|>\\\"task performance, model efficacy\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Jeopardy Question\\\"<|>\\\"RAG Models\\\"<|>\\\"RAG Models generate responses to Jeopardy Questions, showcasing their capability in diverse inquiry formats.\\\"<|>\\\"task demonstration, model versatility\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Scotland\\\"<|>\\\"Jeopardy Question\\\"<|>\\\"Scotland is referenced in a Jeopardy Question context regarding currency, linking it to the task type.\\\"<|>\\\"geographical relevance, inquiry context\\\"<|>7)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Middle Ear\\\"<|>\\\"RAG Models\\\"<|>\\\"RAG Models generate definitions such as that of the middle ear, indicating their application in providing specific medical knowledge.\\\"<|>\\\"knowledge generation, contextual accuracy\\\"<|>8)##\\n<|COMPLETE|>\"}]\nMANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

Factuality and Specificity. The table is structured in a 3-column format where the first column lists different comparison categories between the models BART and RAG, while the second and third columns provide the corresponding percentages for Factuality and Specificity. Notably, 'RAG better' shines with 42.7% in Factuality, which is significantly higher than BART's 7.1%, illustrating that RAG's outputs are perceived as more accurate. Similarly, for Specificity, RAG again outperformed BART with 37.4% compared to 16.8% for BART. The data points suggest a clear trend favoring RAG over BART in both assessments, indicating that RAG provides more factual and specific outputs, aligning with the surrounding analysis declaring RAG as superior in generative tasks. The existence of 'Both good' and 'Both poor' categories with 11.7% and 17.7%, respectively, suggest that while there are successful cases for both models, RAG often yields more acceptable results. This table supports the surrounding content's claims regarding RAG's performance in comparison to classic models like BART, reinforcing its advancements in generative tasks used across various NLP applications.\n\n---Output---\nOutput:",

The header indicates the models tested (specifically RAG-Token and RAG-Sequence with different configurations like BM25 and Frozen), followed by performance scores in different tasks: NQ (Natural Questions), TQA (Trivia Question Answering), WQ (Web Questions), CT (Close Test), and metrics for Jeopardy-QGen and MSMarco. Key data points reveal that RAG models, particularly RAG-Sequence, exhibit superior performance across almost all metrics compared to their RAG-Token counterparts, with notable significant differences in Exact Match and ROUGE-L scores. The table correlates with the surrounding content emphasizing the superiority of retrieval-augmented generation models over conventional models, boosting factual accuracy and specificity, particularly in open-domain question answering. The patterns illustrate a tangible benefit in learning retrieval for tasks with diverse needs, supporting the document's assertion that non-parametric memory can enhance the task flexibility and performance of NLP models. The high statistics, such as RAG-Sequence achieving 44.0 in NQ and 57.2 in ROUGE-L, correlate with the findings suggesting that sophisticated retrieval mechanisms can significantly improve model output quality across varying backgrounds, affirming the innovative leap in retrieval-based architectures discussed throughout the document.\n\n---Output---\nOutput:",

None\n\nAnalysis: The table presents a comparison of the ratio of distinct to total tri-grams generated by different models (Gold, BART, RAG-Token, RAG-Sequence) across two generation tasks: MSMARCO and Jeopardy QGen. The structure of the table includes two primary columns: one for the model names and the other for the distinct-to-total tri-gram ratios for each generation task. The 'Gold' row, which serves as a benchmark, achieved the highest ratios, particularly in the Jeopardy QGen task at 90.0%. BART demonstrated the lowest performance overall, indicating its generation's lack of diversity, especially in Jeopardy QGen (32.4%). In contrast, both RAG models, particularly RAG-Sequence (83.5% and 53.8% respectively), indicated notable improvements in diversity over BART, showcasing the effectiveness of the RAG architecture in generating diverse outputs. The surrounding context highlights the significance of retrieval-enhanced architectures, aligning with the table's findings that model retrieval capabilities can lead to more factually rich and diverse generations, which is critical in NLP applications such as open-domain QA.\n\n---Output---\nOutput:",

Factuality and Specificity. The table is structured in a 3-column format where the first column lists different comparison categories between the models BART and RAG, while the second and third columns provide the corresponding percentages for Factuality and Specificity. Notably, 'RAG better' shines with 42.7% in Factuality, which is significantly higher than BART's 7.1%, illustrating that RAG's outputs are perceived as more accurate. Similarly, for Specificity, RAG again outperformed BART with 37.4% compared to 16.8% for BART. The data points suggest a clear trend favoring RAG over BART in both assessments, indicating that RAG provides more factual and specific outputs, aligning with the surrounding analysis declaring RAG as superior in generative tasks. The existence of 'Both good' and 'Both poor' categories with 11.7% and 17.7%, respectively, suggest that while there are successful cases for both models, RAG often yields more acceptable results.

None\\n\\nAnalysis: The table presents a comparison of the ratio of distinct to total tri-grams generated by different models (Gold, BART, RAG-Token, RAG-Sequence) across two generation tasks: MSMARCO and Jeopardy QGen. The structure of the table includes two primary columns: one for the model names and the other for the distinct-to-total tri-gram ratios for each generation task. The 'Gold' row, which serves as a benchmark, achieved the highest ratios, particularly in the Jeopardy QGen task at 90.0%. BART demonstrated the lowest performance overall, indicating its generation's lack of diversity, especially in Jeopardy QGen (32.4%). In contrast, both RAG models, particularly RAG-Sequence (83.5% and 53.8% respectively), indicated notable improvements in diversity over BART, showcasing the effectiveness of the RAG architecture in generating diverse outputs. The surrounding context highlights the significance of retrieval-enhanced architectures, aligning with the table's findings that model retrieval capabilities can lead to more factually rich and diverse generations, which is critical in NLP applications such as open-domain QA.\\n\\n---Output---\\nOutput:\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"MSMARCO\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"MSMARCO is a collection of datasets used for training models in natural language processing, specifically for question answering tasks.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Jeopardy QGen\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Jeopardy QGen is a generation task that evaluates models on producing answers in the style of Jeopardy questions.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Gold\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"Gold is the benchmark model that achieved the highest ratios of distinct to total tri-grams in the evaluated tasks.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"BART\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"BART is a model that performed poorly in generating diverse outputs, especially in the Jeopardy QGen task.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"RAG-Token\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"RAG-Token is a retrieval-augmented model that demonstrated notable improvements in generating diverse outputs compared to BART.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"RAG-Sequence\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"RAG-Sequence is another retrieval-augmented model that showed significant effectiveness in generating diverse outputs for both tasks.\\\")##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Gold\\\"<|>\\\"MSMARCO\\\"<|>\\\"Gold model serves as a benchmark for evaluating the performance of other models on the MSMARCO task.\\\"<|>\\\"benchmarking, model evaluation\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Gold\\\"<|>\\\"Jeopardy QGen\\\"<|>\\\"Gold achieved the highest ratio in the Jeopardy QGen task, establishing a standard for comparison.\\\"<|>\\\"benchmarking, performance metrics\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"BART\\\"<|>\\\"Jeopardy QGen\\\"<|>\\\"BART's lower performance in Jeopardy QGen indicates its lack of diversity in output generation for this task.\\\"<|>\\\"performance analysis, output diversity\\\"<|>7)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"RAG-Token\\\"<|>\\\"BART\\\"<|>\\\"RAG-Token showed improvements over BART in generating diverse outputs, indicating a better performance overall.\\\"<|>\\\"model comparison, diversity enhancement\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"RAG-Sequence\\\"<|>\\\"BART\\\"<|>\\\"RAG-Sequence indicated notable enhancements in diversity compared to BART, particularly in the evaluated tasks.\\\"<|>\\\"model comparison, performance enhancement\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"RAG-Sequence\\\"<|>\\\"RAG-Token\\\"<|>\\\"Both RAG models showcase the effectiveness of retrieval-augmented architectures in generating diverse outputs.\\\"<|>\\\"model effectiveness, architecture advantage\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"content_keywords\\\"<|>\\\"natural language processing, model evaluation, diversity in generation, retrieval-augmented models\\\")<|COMPLETE|>\"}]\nMANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

The interface is centered around fact-checking by comparing the factual accuracy of two given sentences about a subject. At the top of the interface is a prompt that reads: 'Which sentence is more factually true?' Below this prompt, the subject 'Hemingway' is written, followed by two sentences for comparison. Sentence A states: '\"The Sun Also Rises\" is a novel by this author of \"A Farewell to Arms\".' Sentence B claims: 'This author of \"The Sun Also Rises\" was born in Havana, Cuba, the son of Spanish immigrants.' Beside the sentences, on the right side, there are multiple choice options numbered from 1 to 4, offering: 'Sentence A is more true', 'Sentence B is more true', 'Both sentences are true', and 'Both sentences are completely untrue'. On the far left, there is additional instructional text in two colors. Blue text offers links to 'View full instructions' and 'View tool guide'. Below this, red text indicates: 'Note: Some questions are control questions. We require good accuracy on our control questions to accept responses.' Black text advises: 'Indicate which one of the following sentences is more factually true with respect to the subject. Using the internet to check whether the sentences are true is encouraged.' The layout is clean and structured for ease of navigation. The visual style is minimalistic, predominantly using black text on a white background, with strategic use of red and blue for emphasis. The context surrounding this interface suggests it is part of a controlled human evaluation study, possibly related to natural language processing tasks such as knowledge verification.\n\n---Output---\nOutput:",

All graphs have the same x-axis labeled 'K Retrieved Docs', indicating the number of documents retrieved, ranging typically from 0 to 50. The first graph on the left is titled 'NQ Exact Match' and features two main data lines: one in solid orange representing 'RAG-Tok' and one in dashed teal for 'RAG-Seq'. Both lines start high near the y-axis top and show performance leveling out past 10 documents, with the orange line slightly declining while the teal stays steady. The second middle graph measures 'NQ Answer Recall @K', plotting both 'RAG-Tok' and 'RAG-Seq' in solid orange and dashed teal, respectively, along with additional data points for 'Fixed DPR' (in turquoise) and 'BM25' (in dotted purple). The graphs exhibit recall performance that increases steeply and then plateaus, with 'BM25' performing less strongly compared to other methods. The third graph on the right shows 'Bleu-1 / Rouge-L score', with two orange lines (solid for Rouge-L, long-dashed for Bleu-1) and two teal lines (dashed for Rouge-L and densely dashed for Bleu-1). Here, Bleu-1 scores tend to decrease slightly with more documents, while Rouge-L remains steady, reflecting stability in response quality with increasing K. Overall, both 'RAG-Tok' and 'RAG-Seq' are tracked across all graphs, maintaining readability with distinct coloring and line styles. Background and graph frame are minimalist, emphasizing data clarity.\n\n---Output---\nOutput:",

The header indicates the models tested (specifically RAG-Token and RAG-Sequence with different configurations like BM25 and Frozen), followed by performance scores in different tasks: NQ (Natural Questions), TQA (Trivia Question Answering), WQ (Web Questions), CT (Close Test), and metrics for Jeopardy-QGen and MSMarco. Key data points reveal that RAG models, particularly RAG-Sequence, exhibit superior performance across almost all metrics compared to their RAG-Token counterparts, with notable significant differences in Exact Match and ROUGE-L scores. The table correlates with the surrounding content emphasizing the superiority of retrieval-augmented generation models over conventional models, boosting factual accuracy and specificity, particularly in open-domain question answering. The patterns illustrate a tangible benefit in learning retrieval for tasks with diverse needs, supporting the document's assertion that non-parametric memory can enhance the task flexibility and performance of NLP models. The high statistics, such as RAG-Sequence achieving 44.0 in NQ and 57.2 in ROUGE-L, correlate with the findings suggesting that sophisticated retrieval mechanisms can significantly improve model output quality across varying backgrounds, affirming the innovative leap in retrieval-based architectures discussed throughout the document.\\n\\n---Output---\\nOutput:\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"RAG-Token-BM25\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"RAG-Token-BM25 is a model tested for its performance metrics in various natural language processing tasks.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"RAG-Sequence-BM25\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"RAG-Sequence-BM25 is a model variant known for superior performance in retrieval-based tasks compared to RAG-Token.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"NQ\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"NQ (Natural Questions) is a task for which performance metrics were evaluated, serving as a measure of model efficacy in understanding questions.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"TQA\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"TQA (Trivia Question Answering) is a performance evaluation task for models aimed at assessing their ability to answer trivia questions accurately.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"WQ\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"WQ (Web Questions) is a category in which model performance was analyzed regarding their capability to process web-based questions.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"CT\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"CT (Close Test) is a performance metric category that assesses model effectiveness in fill-in-the-blank type queries.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Jeopardy-QGen\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Jeopardy-QGen refers to a game show-inspired question generation task where model performance is measured.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"MSMarco\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"MSMarco is a benchmark dataset used for evaluating the accuracy and retrieval capabilities of natural language processing models.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"RAG-Sequence\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"RAG-Sequence is noted for demonstrating superior performance in several metrics compared to RAG-Token and is particularly impactful in NLP tasks.\\\")##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"RAG-Sequence-BM25\\\"<|>\\\"RAG-Sequence\\\"<|>\\\"RAG-Sequence-BM25 is a model variant of RAG-Sequence, indicating a direct relationship in performance evaluation studies.\\\"<|>\\\"model variant, performance assessment\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"RAG-Token-BM25\\\"<|>\\\"RAG-Sequence-BM25\\\"<|>\\\"RAG-Token-BM25 and RAG-Sequence-BM25 are both tested models in performance comparisons for NLP tasks.\\\"<|>\\\"model comparison, performance analysis\\\"<|>6)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"RAG-Sequence\\\"<|>\\\"NQ\\\"<|>\\\"RAG-Sequence shows high performance specifically in the NQ task, illustrating its efficacy in handling natural questions.\\\"<|>\\\"task performance, efficiency\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"RAG-Sequence\\\"<|>\\\"TQA\\\"<|>\\\"RAG-Sequence also performs well in the TQA task, demonstrating its capability in trivia question answering.\\\"<|>\\\"task performance, efficiency\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"RAG-Sequence\\\"<|>\\\"WQ\\\"<|>\\\"The RAG-Sequence model's performance metrics in WQ showcase its robustness in processing web-based questions.\\\"<|>\\\"task performance, efficiency\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"RAG-Sequence\\\"<|>\\\"CT\\\"<|>\\\"RAG-Sequence achieves significant scores in the CT task, reflecting its proficiency in completion type queries.\\\"<|>\\\"task performance, efficiency\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"RAG-Sequence\\\"<|>\\\"Jeopardy-QGen\\\"<|>\\\"RAG-Sequence's metrics extend to Jeopardy-QGen, indicating its diverse applicability in question generation tasks.\\\"<|>\\\"task performance, efficiency\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"RAG-Sequence\\\"<|>\\\"MSMarco\\\"<|>\\\"RAG-Sequence's performance is evaluated using MSMarco, highlighting its relevance in contemporary NLP challenges.\\\"<|>\\\"benchmark evaluation, task relevance\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"content_keywords\\\"<|>\\\"natural language processing, model performance, retrieval-augmented generation, task evaluation, efficiency\\\")<|COMPLETE|>\"}]\nMANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

The interface is centered around fact-checking by comparing the factual accuracy of two given sentences about a subject. At the top of the interface is a prompt that reads: 'Which sentence is more factually true?' Below this prompt, the subject 'Hemingway' is written, followed by two sentences for comparison. Sentence A states: '\\\"The Sun Also Rises\\\" is a novel by this author of \\\"A Farewell to Arms\\\".' Sentence B claims: 'This author of \\\"The Sun Also Rises\\\" was born in Havana, Cuba, the son of Spanish immigrants.' Beside the sentences, on the right side, there are multiple choice options numbered from 1 to 4, offering: 'Sentence A is more true', 'Sentence B is more true', 'Both sentences are true', and 'Both sentences are completely untrue'. On the far left, there is additional instructional text in two colors. Blue text offers links to 'View full instructions' and 'View tool guide'. Below this, red text indicates: 'Note: Some questions are control questions. We require good accuracy on our control questions to accept responses.' Black text advises: 'Indicate which one of the following sentences is more factually true with respect to the subject. Using the internet to check whether the sentences are true is encouraged.' The layout is clean and structured for ease of navigation. The visual style is minimalistic, predominantly using black text on a white background, with strategic use of red and blue for emphasis.

None\n\nAnalysis: The table presents the number of instances across different datasets used for open-domain question answering (QA) tasks. It is structured with four columns: 'Task', 'Train', 'Development', and 'Test'. Each row represents a different dataset. The 'Train' column lists the number of training instances, the 'Development' column the instances used for validation, and the 'Test' column the number of instances used for testing. Key data points show that 'MS-MARCO' has the highest number of training instances (153726) and 'CuratedTrec' has the lowest (635), indicating varying dataset sizes and complexities. There's a pattern where datasets like 'TriviaQA' have more test instances (11314) than training (78786), suggesting a focus on robust evaluation. Statistical insights reveal that datasets with larger training sets, like 'Natural Questions' and 'FEVER-3-way', tend to feature more instances across all categories, hinting at the importance of substantial training data for model performance. The relationship of data elements emphasizes the necessity for diverse, large datasets in enhancing QA model training, aligning with the study's discussion on utilizing multiple answer annotations and filtering techniques to improve accuracy for RAG and other models. This data supports the surrounding content's focus on the significance of thorough dataset preparation and evaluation for optimizing open-domain QA systems.\n\n---Output---\nOutput:",

None\\n\\nAnalysis: The table presents the number of instances across different datasets used for open-domain question answering (QA) tasks. It is structured with four columns: 'Task', 'Train', 'Development', and 'Test'. Each row represents a different dataset. The 'Train' column lists the number of training instances, the 'Development' column the instances used for validation, and the 'Test' column the number of instances used for testing. Key data points show that 'MS-MARCO' has the highest number of training instances (153726) and 'CuratedTrec' has the lowest (635), indicating varying dataset sizes and complexities. There's a pattern where datasets like 'TriviaQA' have more test instances (11314) than training (78786), suggesting a focus on robust evaluation. Statistical insights reveal that datasets with larger training sets, like 'Natural Questions' and 'FEVER-3-way', tend to feature more instances across all categories, hinting at the importance of substantial training data for model performance. The relationship of data elements emphasizes the necessity for diverse, large datasets in enhancing QA model training, aligning with the study's discussion on utilizing multiple answer annotations and filtering techniques to improve accuracy for RAG and other models. This data supports the surrounding content's focus on the significance of thorough dataset preparation and evaluation for optimizing open-domain QA systems.\\n\\n---Output---\\nOutput:\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Natural Questions\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Natural Questions is a dataset used for open-domain question answering, featuring 79169 training instances.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"TriviaQA\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"TriviaQA is a dataset for open-domain QA that includes 78786 training instances and has more test instances than training.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"WebQuestions\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"WebQuestions is a dataset utilized in QA tasks with 3418 training instances.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"CuratedTrec\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"CuratedTrec is a QA dataset with 635 training instances, the lowest among the listed datasets.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Jeopardy Question Generation\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Jeopardy Question Generation is a dataset with 97392 training instances and focuses on generating questions.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"MS-MARCO\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"MS-MARCO is a dataset comprised of 153726 training instances, the highest among the datasets mentioned.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"FEVER-3-way\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"FEVER-3-way is a dataset with 145450 training instances used in QA tasks.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"FEVER-2-way\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"FEVER-2-way is a QA dataset that contains 96966 training instances.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Table 7\\\"<|>\\\"event\\\"<|>\\\"Table 7 presents a count of instances across various QA datasets, reflecting their structure and usage.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Open-domain Question Answering Tasks\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Open-domain question answering tasks involve utilizing datasets to generate answers to questions based on given information.\\\")##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Natural Questions\\\"<|>\\\"MS-MARCO\\\"<|>\\\"Natural Questions and MS-MARCO are both datasets used for training in open-domain QA tasks, highlighting different dataset sizes and complexities.\\\"<|>\\\"dataset comparison, QA performance\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"TriviaQA\\\"<|>\\\"Natural Questions\\\"<|>\\\"TriviaQA features more test instances than training instances, which is a notable characteristic compared to Natural Questions.\\\"<|>\\\"dataset evaluation strategy, training vs testing\\\"<|>6)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"MS-MARCO\\\"<|>\\\"CuratedTrec\\\"<|>\\\"MS-MARCO has the highest number of training instances while CuratedTrec has the lowest, showing the diversity in dataset sizes.\\\"<|>\\\"dataset disparity, QA dataset size\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"FEVER-3-way\\\"<|>\\\"FEVER-2-way\\\"<|>\\\"Both FEVER datasets are used in QA with significant differences in their number of training instances.\\\"<|>\\\"dataset similarity, QA usage\\\"<|>7)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Table 7\\\"<|>\\\"Open-domain Question Answering Tasks\\\"<|>\\\"Table 7 summarizes and presents the number of instances from various datasets pertinent to open-domain question answering tasks.\\\"<|>\\\"data analysis, dataset evaluation\\\"<|>10)##\\n(\\\"content_keywords\\\"<|>\\\"dataset analysis, QA tasks, training instances, data complexity, evaluation strategy\\\")<|COMPLETE|>\"}]\nMANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

None\\n\\nVisual Analysis: The image consists of three separate line graphs displayed horizontally, each representing different performance metrics of retrieval-based models across varying numbers of retrieved documents (K). All graphs have the same x-axis labeled 'K Retrieved Docs', indicating the number of documents retrieved, ranging typically from 0 to 50. The first graph on the left is titled 'NQ Exact Match' and features two main data lines: one in solid orange representing 'RAG-Tok' and one in dashed teal for 'RAG-Seq'. Both lines start high near the y-axis top and show performance leveling out past 10 documents, with the orange line slightly declining while the teal stays steady. The second middle graph measures 'NQ Answer Recall @K', plotting both 'RAG-Tok' and 'RAG-Seq' in solid orange and dashed teal, respectively, along with additional data points for 'Fixed DPR' (in turquoise) and 'BM25' (in dotted purple). The graphs exhibit recall performance that increases steeply and then plateaus, with 'BM25' performing less strongly compared to other methods. The third graph on the right shows 'Bleu-1 / Rouge-L score', with two orange lines (solid for Rouge-L, long-dashed for Bleu-1) and two teal lines (dashed for Rouge-L and densely dashed for Bleu-1). Here, Bleu-1 scores tend to decrease slightly with more documents, while Rouge-L remains steady, reflecting stability in response quality with increasing K.

    "return": "BART, which stands for Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers, is a pre-trained sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) transformer model that excels in various language generation tasks. It utilizes a denoising objective during its training process, which enhances its ability to generate coherent and contextually relevant text. This model is particularly significant when used in conjunction with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), leveraging the strengths of both BART and BERT for improved text processing and information synthesis.\n\nBART is recognized for generating factually accurate responses, making it a valuable tool for tasks such as question generation. It serves as a baseline model in this domain, achieving a BLEU-1 score of 15.1; however, this performance is considered lower than that of the RAG-Token variant, indicating that while BART is effective, it can be outperformed in metrics related to response quality and accuracy.\n\nDespite its strengths, BART has been noted for generating outputs with lower diversity, especially evident in specific applications, such as the Jeopardy Question Generation (QGen) task. This limitation highlights the need for diversity-promoting decoding strategies when using BART, which can help alleviate the tendency toward repetitive or less varied responses.\n\nIn the context of RAG, BART is used as a comparative benchmark for generating answers. However, outputs generated by BART can often be uncertain or only partially accurate, depending on the complexity and context of the queries it handles. In scenarios where the retrieval component of the RAG model fails or is less effective, BART's performance remains comparable, underscoring its robustness as a foundational model for text generation.\n\nOverall, BART represents an important contribution to the field of natural language processing due to its innovative design and capabilities in facilitating the integration of knowledge sources into coherent text generation. Its effectiveness in various tasks—including text generation and question formulation—coupled with its incorporation into more complex systems like RAG, establishes BART as a significant entity in advanced AI-driven language understanding and production.",

    "return": "### Algorithm Analysis for Real-Time Classification Tasks\n\nBased on the provided table \"Comparison of Machine Learning Algorithm Performance,\" we can analyze which algorithm is best suited for real-time classification tasks. Here is a breakdown of the performance metrics for each algorithm:\n\n#### 1. Accuracy:\n- **Neural Network**: 92.1%\n- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: 88.7%\n- **Random Forest**: 85.2%\n\nNeural networks have the highest accuracy, making them desirable when correctness is a priority.\n\n#### 2. Speed:\n- **Random Forest**: Fast\n- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: Fast\n- **Neural Network**: Medium\n\nSpeed is critical for real-time systems. Both Random Forest and SVM are classified as fast, which could make them more suitable when prompt responses are required.\n\n#### 3. Memory Usage:\n- **Neural Network**: High\n- **Random Forest**: Medium\n- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: Low\n\nIn low-resource environments, memory usage could be a limiting factor, favoring SVM, which uses the least memory.\n\n### Softmax Function Analysis\n\nThe softmax function is essential for classification tasks, especially when dealing with multiple classes. The formula:\n\n\\[\nP(y|x) = \\frac{e^{f(x)}}{\\sum_{j=1}^{K} e^{f_j(x)}}\n\\]\n\nThis function converts logits, or raw prediction scores, from models into probabilities. This transformation is crucial as it ensures that the outputs can be interpreted as probabilities, summing to one, making it easier to select the most likely class. The softmax is frequently used in neural networks, which often serve as final layer activation functions in multi-class classification setups. However, due to medium speed in neural networks, applying them in real-time systems might need careful consideration regarding response times.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nFor real-time classification tasks, Random Forest and Support Vector Machine offer speed advantages, while SVM ensures low memory use, making it optimal when resource constraints exist. Neural Networks, with higher accuracy, are beneficial when predictive precision is paramount but might require optimization to meet real-time demands.\n\n### References\n\n- Analysis based on performance metrics: [DC] 2005.11401v4.pdf\n- Understanding of the softmax function and its relevance: General knowledge applicable in context.",
