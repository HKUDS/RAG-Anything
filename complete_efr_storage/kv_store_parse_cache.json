Existing answer attribution methods struggle to ground responses in source charts due to limited visual-semantic context, complex visual-text alignment requirements, and difficulties in bounding box prediction across complex layouts. We present ChartCitor, a multi-agent framework that provides fine-grained bounding box citations by identifying supporting evidence within chart images. The system orchestrates LLM agents to perform chart-to-table extraction, answer reformulation, table augmentation, evidence retrieval through prefiltering and re-ranking, and table-to-chart mapping. ChartCitor outperforms existing baselines across different chart types. Qualitative user studies show that ChartCitor helps increase user trust in Generative AI by providing enhanced explainability for LLMassisted chart QA and enables professionals to be more productive.

        "text": "Chart data finds extensive use across diverse domains such as healthcare, finance, and education. Recently, LLMs such as Llama-3.2 [16], Claude-3.5 Sonnet, and GPT-4V [1] have proven effective in utilizing in-context learning and visual prompting to interpret and reason over chart images. However, these models tend to hallucinate — generate answers with semantically plausible but factually incorrect information — which undermines their reliability and erodes user trust [14, 19]. While existing approaches attempt to address hallucination by grounding LLM-generated responses in source documents through citation mechanisms [7], charts present unique challenges: (i) complex mapping between visual elements and underlying data, (ii) limited contextual information due to compressed visual data representation, (iii) difficulty in localizing chart elements across diverse visualization types and layouts, and (iv) ambiguity in alignment between text descriptions and visual elements. Prior research has explored various approaches to address this challenge, including instruction tuning [8], in-context learning [5], and natural-language inference (NLI)-based post-hoc attribution methods [4]. However, these approaches have primarily focused on attributing entire charts rather than specific structural elements [6], limiting their practical utility. To address these limitations, we propose ChartCitor, a system that provides visual evidence for generated answers by identifying and highlighting relevant chart elements through bounding box annotations. ChartCitor works by orchestrating multiple specialized LLM agents to: (1) extract structured data table from charts, (2) break down answers into logical steps, (3) generate contextual descriptions for rows/columns, (4) identify supporting evidence through pre-filtering and re-ranking to connect specific table cells to claims, and (5) localize the selected cells in the chart image. ChartCitor helps professionals save time on fact-checking LLM-generated answers and enhances user trust by providing reliable and logically-explained citations sourced from charts. ",

We utilize GPT-4V to comprehend PDF images and output corresponding HTML without the need for external OCR using few shot prompting to identify cell data across each row/column. We use visual self-reflection [13] to provide the GPT-4V with its own rendered HTML and data table output to check for consistency between the re-plotted LLM output and the original chart. In case of inconsistencies in the data extraction, the LLM refines its output until the extracted table data is error-free. (2) Answer Reformulation Agent: The answer to be attributed, which can be AI-generated or otherwise, may be composed of multiple facts, numerical formulations and multi-hop logic. Each fact may be sourced from a different row/column in the chart table. To facilitate precise citations, re-framing the answer statement into a chain of reasoning steps helps to better retrieve the correct citations from the table. We convert the answer statement into a hierarchy of reasoning thoughts/arguments via few-shot in-context prompting, ensuring the resultant answer arguments are independent sentences without any deviation in their collective meaning from the original answer statement.

Tables often present analytical challenges through ambiguous content, including technical terminology, contextless numeric values, domain-specific symbols, and hierarchical row/column headers. These ambiguities impede reliable evidence extraction and citation validation through semantic matching. Our solution leverages LLMs in an unsupervised manner to generate rich, multi-layered contextual descriptions: (i) Row Captioning: Our system employs GPT-4o to generate comprehensive row-level descriptions that capture complex patterns across features, summarize temporal trends, highlight significant dates and provide comparative analysis with respect to outliers within each row. (ii) Column Captioning: We generate detailed captions for each column using GPT-4o to explain ambiguous measurement units, symbols, empty cell spaces, and technical relationship of it’s contents with corresponding row headers. (iii) Cell Captioning: Row and column-level captions may highlight broader trends but the fine-grained cell level information needs to be contextualized in terms of its associated row and column headers. Captioning agent uses GPT-4o to describe the importance of each cell in the context of its associated row and columns. ",

Passing irrelevant and distracting table entities to the LLM-based re-ranker can mislead it, negatively impacting the ranking process. Inspired by [11], the LLM-based pre-filtering step uses chain-of-thought [18] followed by Plan and Solve [17] prompting techniques to generate a relevance score for each row/column based on the significance of its descriptive caption to the given answer statement (between 0 to 1). Additionally, we prompt the LLM to explain its rationale behind the score generation to enhance explainability and avoid hallucinations. We establish a specific threshold (usually $0 . 3 - 0 . 5 )$ ) for row/column filtering to retain potential citations that are sent to the re-ranker, discarding those falling below the threshold. This implementation significantly reduces the number of noisy of rows and columns that can misguide the re-ranker, leading to an improved citation retrieval performance. ",

Kosmos-2 and LISA perform poorly, with very low IoU scores, highlighting their inability to handle factual grounding in charts due to insufficient visual and numerical reasoning. Interestingly, all tested method including our proposed ChartCitor, zero-shot LMM prompting, LISA and KOSMOS2 struggle with interpreting complex geometrical proportions in pie charts due to their difficulty in handling non-rectangular bounding box segmentation task. Further, we conducted a user study (Fig. 2(b) to evaluate the citation accuracy and perceived utility of fine-grained chart attribution provided by ChartCitor. Five participants evaluated 250 randomly sampled question-answer pairs with associated chart images to study the usefulness and accuracy of the citations provided by ChartCitor compared to direct GPT-4o prompting. The evaluation results demonstrated strong positive reception, with participants rating the attributions as Completely Accurate $4 1 \\%$ vs $2 8 \\%$ ) or Somewhat Accurate ( $1 7 \\%$ vs $1 5 \\%$ ) for verifying chart-based question answering accuracy in ChartCitor and GPT-4o, respectively. Attributions were found to be more \"Completely Inaccurate\" ChartCitor than GPT-4o ( $1 7 \\%$ vs $3 1 \\%$ ). Participants described the citations as a handy tool in making verification of LLM-generated answers easier (\"...can help me to quickly verify trends in charts, cutting down the time I spent on 10 documents from 5 hrs to 20 mins.\").
