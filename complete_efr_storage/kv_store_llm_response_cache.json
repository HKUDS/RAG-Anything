Tables often present analytical challenges through ambiguous content, including technical terminology, contextless numeric values, domain-specific symbols, and hierarchical row/column headers. These ambiguities impede reliable evidence extraction and citation validation through semantic matching. Our solution leverages LLMs in an unsupervised manner to generate rich, multi-layered contextual descriptions: (i) Row Captioning: Our system employs GPT-4o to generate comprehensive row-level descriptions that capture complex patterns across features, summarize temporal trends, highlight significant dates and provide comparative analysis with respect to outliers within each row. (ii) Column Captioning: We generate detailed captions for each column using GPT-4o to explain ambiguous measurement units, symbols, empty cell spaces, and technical relationship of it’s contents with corresponding row headers. (iii) Cell Captioning: Row and column-level captions may highlight broader trends but the fine-grained cell level information needs to be contextualized in terms of its associated row and column headers. Captioning agent uses GPT-4o to describe the importance of each cell in the context of its associated row and columns. \n\nTable Cell Retrieval: We use retrieve-then-rank approach to identify the most relevant table cells. Our two-step approach begins with LLM-based pre-filtering to reject irrelevant rows and columns. We then employ LLM re-ranking to retrieve the most precise cell-level matches, ensuring both comprehensive coverage and accuracy in the final selection. \n\n(4) LLM Pre-filtering Agent: We hypothesize that some of the table rows/ columns are likely to be unrelated to the answer facts. Passing irrelevant and distracting table entities to the LLM-based re-ranker can mislead it, negatively impacting the ranking process. Inspired by [11], the LLM-based pre-filtering step uses chain-of-thought [18] followed by Plan and Solve [17] prompting techniques to generate a relevance score for each row/column based on the significance of its descriptive caption to the given answer statement (between 0 to 1). Additionally, we prompt the LLM to explain its rationale behind the score generation to enhance explainability and avoid hallucinations. We establish a specific threshold (usually $0 . 3 - 0 . 5 )$ ) for row/column filtering to retain potential citations that are sent to the re-ranker, discarding those falling below the threshold. This implementation significantly reduces the number of noisy of rows and columns that can misguide the re-ranker, leading to an improved citation retrieval performance. \n\n(5) LLM Re-ranking Agent: LLMs providing citations that don’t directly support their claims can be interpreted as a form of hallucination which may diminish user confidence. To solve this, we retrieve the set of table cells that are collectively both sufficient and directly relevant to the answer claims. We use RankGPT [15], a listwise LLM re-ranker to re-rank the table cells extracted from the intersection of rows and columns selected in the pre-filtering stage. Additionally, we prompt GPT-4o to provide a layer-of-thought [3] explanation of its rationale in ranking the cell items, enhancing the transparency in the citation mechanism by enforcing a logical coherence in the evidence chain. \n\n(6) Cell Localization Agent: The final step maps cited table cells to their corresponding visual elements in the chart image. This agent leverages DETR trained [2] on ChartQA data to identify all possible data marks (bars, line segments, pie slices) using image processing algorithms. GPT-4V with few-shot set-of-marks prompting [20] then identifies elements corresponding to the cited cells. The agent generates bounding box coordinates for the relevant visual elements, employing visual self-reflection to verify precise correspondence between highlighted regions and cited data points. \n\n3 Implementation Details \n\nAll constituent agents utilize textual LLM APIs such as those provided by OpenAI (GPT-4o, GPT-4V) or Claude Sonnet-3.5. We use ChatGPT $- 4 0$ as the base multimodal language model (MLLM) for ChartCitor. We convert data tables from TabCite benchmark [10] into bar/pie/line charts along with paired QA. \n\nEvaluation: We adopt visual Intersection over Union (IoU) as principal metric for chart attribution tasks. Detected regions in the chart image are matched to ground truth regions (e.g., bars in barplot or pies in piechart) based on a threshold value of $\\mathrm { I o U } \\ge 0 . 9 .$ Unlike bar charts and pie charts, where detected regions can be matched to discrete ground truth regions, line charts involve discrete points. Since grounding models generate bounding boxes or regions, we compute the proportion of ground truth points covered within the detected region(s) over total points detected. \n\nBaselines: (1) Zero-shot LLM Bounding Box Prompting – We prompt GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet to predict normalized bounding box coordinates for chart components based on input text and the visual chart. (2) Kosmos-2 [12] is a multimodal LLM with textto-visual grounding capabilities. It represents object locations as Markdown links for generating bounding boxes for visual grounding tasks. (3) LISA (Large Language Instructed Segmentation Assistant) [9] is a reasoning-based zero-shot segmentation model that generates masks from implicit and complex textual queries. \n\n4 Results and Discussion \n\nTable 2(a) shows quantitative results that demonstrate that ChartCitor consistently outperforms the baselines across all chart types, highlighting its robustness and effectiveness in visual chart understanding. ChartCitor achieves better performance compared to directly prompting LLMs to predict bounding boxes. Further, even \n\nusing GPT-4V with set of marks prompting\n\n---Output---\nOutput:",

ChartCitor achieves better performance compared to directly prompting LLMs to predict bounding boxes. Further, even \n\nusing GPT-4V with set of marks prompting over detected chart elements show weak performance. Kosmos-2 and LISA perform poorly, with very low IoU scores, highlighting their inability to handle factual grounding in charts due to insufficient visual and numerical reasoning. Interestingly, all tested method including our proposed ChartCitor, zero-shot LMM prompting, LISA and KOSMOS2 struggle with interpreting complex geometrical proportions in pie charts due to their difficulty in handling non-rectangular bounding box segmentation task. Further, we conducted a user study (Fig. 2(b) to evaluate the citation accuracy and perceived utility of fine-grained chart attribution provided by ChartCitor. Five participants evaluated 250 randomly sampled question-answer pairs with associated chart images to study the usefulness and accuracy of the citations provided by ChartCitor compared to direct GPT-4o prompting. The evaluation results demonstrated strong positive reception, with participants rating the attributions as Completely Accurate $4 1 \\%$ vs $2 8 \\%$ ) or Somewhat Accurate ( $1 7 \\%$ vs $1 5 \\%$ ) for verifying chart-based question answering accuracy in ChartCitor and GPT-4o, respectively. Attributions were found to be more \"Completely Inaccurate\" ChartCitor than GPT-4o ( $1 7 \\%$ vs $3 1 \\%$ ). Participants described the citations as a handy tool in making verification of LLM-generated answers easier (\"...can help me to quickly verify trends in charts, cutting down the time I spent on 10 documents from 5 hrs to 20 mins.\"). \n\n5 Conclusion \n\nWe introduced ChartCitor, which grounds LLM-generated QA responses to chart elements using agentic orchestration and set-ofmarks prompting. The system outperforms baselines by $9 . 1 5 \\%$ and shows promise for rich document QA over PDF collections. While currently effective for single-chart citations, future work can address multi-chart interactions, hallucination mitigation, and explicit citation-text mapping to enhance trustworthy multimodal content generation. \n\nReferences \n\n[1] Josh Achiam, Steven Adler, Sandhini Agarwal, Lama Ahmad, Ilge Akkaya, Florencia Leoni Aleman, Diogo Almeida, Janko Altenschmidt, Sam Altman, Shyamal Anadkat, et al. 2023.

We present ChartCitor, a multi-agent framework that provides fine-grained bounding box citations by identifying supporting evidence within chart images. The system orchestrates LLM agents to perform chart-to-table extraction, answer reformulation, table augmentation, evidence retrieval through prefiltering and re-ranking, and table-to-chart mapping. ChartCitor outperforms existing baselines across different chart types. Qualitative user studies show that ChartCitor helps increase user trust in Generative AI by providing enhanced explainability for LLMassisted chart QA and enables professionals to be more productive. \n\nCCS Concepts \n\n• Information systems Information extraction. \n\nKeywords \n\nVisual Fact Checking, Information Extraction, Multimodal Retrieval, LLM Agents \n\nACM Reference Format: \n\nKanika Goswami, Puneet Mathur, Ryan Rossi, and Franck Dernoncourt. 2025.

ACM, New York, NY, USA, 4 pages. https://doi.org/10.1145/ nnnnnnn.nnnnnnn \n\n1 Introduction \n\nChart data finds extensive use across diverse domains such as healthcare, finance, and education. Recently, LLMs such as Llama-3.2 [16], Claude-3.5 Sonnet, and GPT-4V [1] have proven effective in utilizing in-context learning and visual prompting to interpret and reason over chart images. However, these models tend to hallucinate — generate answers with semantically plausible but factually incorrect information — which undermines their reliability and erodes user trust [14, 19]. While existing approaches attempt to address hallucination by grounding LLM-generated responses in source documents through citation mechanisms [7], charts present unique challenges: (i) complex mapping between visual elements and underlying data, (ii) limited contextual information due to compressed visual data representation, (iii) difficulty in localizing chart elements across diverse visualization types and layouts, and (iv) ambiguity in alignment between text descriptions and visual elements. Prior research has explored various approaches to address this challenge, including instruction tuning [8], in-context learning [5], and natural-language inference (NLI)-based post-hoc attribution methods [4]. However, these approaches have primarily focused on attributing entire charts rather than specific structural elements [6], limiting their practical utility. To address these limitations, we propose ChartCitor, a system that provides visual evidence for generated answers by identifying and highlighting relevant chart elements through bounding box annotations. ChartCitor works by orchestrating multiple specialized LLM agents to: (1) extract structured data table from charts, (2) break down answers into logical steps, (3) generate contextual descriptions for rows/columns, (4) identify supporting evidence through pre-filtering and re-ranking to connect specific table cells to claims, and (5) localize the selected cells in the chart image. ChartCitor helps professionals save time on fact-checking LLM-generated answers and enhances user trust by providing reliable and logically-explained citations sourced from charts. \n\n2 ChartCitor \n\nWe aim to solve the Fine-grained Structured Chart Attribution task which involves identifying graph elements (e.g bars, lines, pies in chart images) that support factual claims in a generated text response to a user’s question. We propose ChartCitor (Fig. 1) – a multiagent framework that provides fine-grained citations for generated answers grounded in chart image by orchestrating multiple LLM agents, which is explained as follows: \n\n(1) Chart2Table Extraction Agent: Charts are predominantly present in PDFs or scanned documents that need to be converted into structured table formats (e.g., CSV, or HTML). We utilize GPT-4V to comprehend PDF images and output corresponding HTML without the need for external OCR using few shot prompting to identify cell data across each row/column. We use visual self-reflection [13] to provide the GPT-4V with its own rendered HTML and data table output to check for consistency between the re-plotted LLM output and the original chart. In case of inconsistencies in the data extraction, the LLM refines its output until the extracted table data is error-free. (2) Answer Reformulation Agent: The answer to be attributed, which can be AI-generated or otherwise, may be composed of multiple facts, numerical formulations and multi-hop logic. Each fact may be sourced from a different row/column in the chart table. To facilitate precise citations, re-framing the answer statement into a chain of reasoning steps helps to better retrieve the correct citations from the table. We convert the answer statement into a hierarchy of reasoning thoughts/arguments via few-shot in-context prompting, ensuring the resultant answer arguments are independent sentences without any deviation in their collective meaning from the original answer statement. \n\n(3) Entity Captioning Agent: Understanding tabular data extends beyond simple cell interpretation, requiring comprehension of how cell information relate to both the table’s structure and its broader context. Tables often present analytical challenges through ambiguous content, including technical terminology, contextless numeric values, domain-specific symbols, and hierarchical row/column headers. These ambiguities impede reliable evidence extraction and citation validation through semantic matching. Our solution leverages LLMs in an unsupervised manner to generate rich, multi-layered contextual descriptions: (i) Row Captioning: Our\n\n---Output---\nOutput:",

requiring comprehension of how cell information relate to both the table’s structure and its broader context. Tables often present analytical challenges through ambiguous content, including technical terminology, contextless numeric values, domain-specific symbols, and hierarchical row/column headers. These ambiguities impede reliable evidence extraction and citation validation through semantic matching. Our solution leverages LLMs in an unsupervised manner to generate rich, multi-layered contextual descriptions: (i) Row Captioning: Our system employs GPT-4o to generate comprehensive row-level descriptions that capture complex patterns across features, summarize temporal trends, highlight significant dates and provide comparative analysis with respect to outliers within each row. (ii) Column Captioning: We generate detailed captions for each column using GPT-4o to explain ambiguous measurement units, symbols, empty cell spaces, and technical relationship of it’s contents with corresponding row headers. (iii) Cell Captioning: Row and column-level captions may highlight broader trends but the fine-grained cell level information needs to be contextualized in terms of its associated row and column headers. Captioning agent uses GPT-4o to describe the importance of each cell in the context of its associated row and columns. \\n\\nTable Cell Retrieval: We use retrieve-then-rank approach to identify the most relevant table cells. Our two-step approach begins with LLM-based pre-filtering to reject irrelevant rows and columns. We then employ LLM re-ranking to retrieve the most precise cell-level matches, ensuring both comprehensive coverage and accuracy in the final selection. \\n\\n(4) LLM Pre-filtering Agent: We hypothesize that some of the table rows/ columns are likely to be unrelated to the answer facts. Passing irrelevant and distracting table entities to the LLM-based re-ranker can mislead it, negatively impacting the ranking process. Inspired by [11], the LLM-based pre-filtering step uses chain-of-thought [18] followed by Plan and Solve [17] prompting techniques to generate a relevance score for each row/column based on the significance of its descriptive caption to the given answer statement (between 0 to 1). Additionally, we prompt the LLM to explain its rationale behind the score generation to enhance explainability and avoid hallucinations. We establish a specific threshold (usually $0 . 3 - 0 . 5 )$ ) for row/column filtering to retain potential citations that are sent to the re-ranker, discarding those falling below the threshold. This implementation significantly reduces the number of noisy of rows and columns that can misguide the re-ranker, leading to an improved citation retrieval performance. \\n\\n(5) LLM Re-ranking Agent: LLMs providing citations that don’t directly support their claims can be interpreted as a form of hallucination which may diminish user confidence. To solve this, we retrieve the set of table cells that are collectively both sufficient and directly relevant to the answer claims. We use RankGPT [15], a listwise LLM re-ranker to re-rank the table cells extracted from the intersection of rows and columns selected in the pre-filtering stage. Additionally, we prompt GPT-4o to provide a layer-of-thought [3] explanation of its rationale in ranking the cell items, enhancing the transparency in the citation mechanism by enforcing a logical coherence in the evidence chain. \\n\\n(6) Cell Localization Agent: The final step maps cited table cells to their corresponding visual elements in the chart image. This agent leverages DETR trained [2] on ChartQA data to identify all possible data marks (bars, line segments, pie slices) using image processing algorithms. GPT-4V with few-shot set-of-marks prompting [20] then identifies elements corresponding to the cited cells. The agent generates bounding box coordinates for the relevant visual elements, employing visual self-reflection to verify precise correspondence between highlighted regions and cited data points. \\n\\n3 Implementation Details \\n\\nAll constituent agents utilize textual LLM APIs such as those provided by OpenAI (GPT-4o, GPT-4V) or Claude Sonnet-3.5. We use ChatGPT $- 4 0$ as the base multimodal language model (MLLM) for ChartCitor. We convert data tables from TabCite benchmark [10] into bar/pie/line charts along with paired QA. \\n\\nEvaluation: We adopt visual Intersection over Union (IoU) as principal metric for chart attribution tasks. Detected regions in the chart image are matched to ground truth regions (e.g., bars in barplot or pies in piechart) based on a threshold value of $\\\\mathrm { I o U } \\\\ge 0 . 9 .$ Unlike bar charts and pie charts, where detected regions can be matched to discrete ground truth regions, line charts involve discrete points. Since grounding models generate bounding boxes or regions, we compute the proportion of ground truth points covered within the detected region(s) over total points detected. \\n\\nBaselines: (1) Zero-shot LLM Bounding Box Prompting – We prompt GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet to predict normalized bounding box coordinates for chart components based on input text and the visual chart. (2) Kosmos-2 [12] is a multimodal LLM with textto-visual grounding capabilities. It represents object locations as Markdown links for generating bounding boxes for visual grounding tasks. (3) LISA (Large Language Instructed Segmentation Assistant) [9] is a reasoning-based zero-shot segmentation model that generates masks from implicit and complex textual queries. \\n\\n4 Results and Discussion \\n\\nTable 2(a) shows quantitative results that demonstrate that ChartCitor consistently outperforms the baselines across all chart types, highlighting its robustness and effectiveness in visual chart understanding. ChartCitor achieves better performance compared to directly prompting LLMs to predict bounding boxes.

Language Models (LLMs) can perform chart question-answering tasks but often generate unverified hallucinated responses. Existing answer attribution methods struggle to ground responses in source charts due to limited visual-semantic context, complex visual-text alignment requirements, and difficulties in bounding box prediction across complex layouts. We present ChartCitor, a multi-agent framework that provides fine-grained bounding box citations by identifying supporting evidence within chart images. The system orchestrates LLM agents to perform chart-to-table extraction, answer reformulation, table augmentation, evidence retrieval through prefiltering and re-ranking, and table-to-chart mapping. ChartCitor outperforms existing baselines across different chart types. Qualitative user studies show that ChartCitor helps increase user trust in Generative AI by providing enhanced explainability for LLMassisted chart QA and enables professionals to be more productive. \\n\\nCCS Concepts \\n\\n• Information systems Information extraction. \\n\\nKeywords \\n\\nVisual Fact Checking, Information Extraction, Multimodal Retrieval, LLM Agents \\n\\nACM Reference Format: \\n\\nKanika Goswami, Puneet Mathur, Ryan Rossi, and Franck Dernoncourt. 2025.

ACM, New York, NY, USA, 4 pages. https://doi.org/10.1145/ nnnnnnn.nnnnnnn \\n\\n1 Introduction \\n\\nChart data finds extensive use across diverse domains such as healthcare, finance, and education. Recently, LLMs such as Llama-3.2 [16], Claude-3.5 Sonnet, and GPT-4V [1] have proven effective in utilizing in-context learning and visual prompting to interpret and reason over chart images. However, these models tend to hallucinate — generate answers with semantically plausible but factually incorrect information — which undermines their reliability and erodes user trust [14, 19]. While existing approaches attempt to address hallucination by grounding LLM-generated responses in source documents through citation mechanisms [7], charts present unique challenges: (i) complex mapping between visual elements and underlying data, (ii) limited contextual information due to compressed visual data representation, (iii) difficulty in localizing chart elements across diverse visualization types and layouts, and (iv) ambiguity in alignment between text descriptions and visual elements. Prior research has explored various approaches to address this challenge, including instruction tuning [8], in-context learning [5], and natural-language inference (NLI)-based post-hoc attribution methods [4]. However, these approaches have primarily focused on attributing entire charts rather than specific structural elements [6], limiting their practical utility. To address these limitations, we propose ChartCitor, a system that provides visual evidence for generated answers by identifying and highlighting relevant chart elements through bounding box annotations. ChartCitor works by orchestrating multiple specialized LLM agents to: (1) extract structured data table from charts, (2) break down answers into logical steps, (3) generate contextual descriptions for rows/columns, (4) identify supporting evidence through pre-filtering and re-ranking to connect specific table cells to claims, and (5) localize the selected cells in the chart image. ChartCitor helps professionals save time on fact-checking LLM-generated answers and enhances user trust by providing reliable and logically-explained citations sourced from charts. \\n\\n2 ChartCitor \\n\\nWe aim to solve the Fine-grained Structured Chart Attribution task which involves identifying graph elements (e.g bars, lines, pies in chart images) that support factual claims in a generated text response to a user’s question. We propose ChartCitor (Fig. 1) – a multiagent framework that provides fine-grained citations for generated answers grounded in chart image by orchestrating multiple LLM agents, which is explained as follows: \\n\\n(1) Chart2Table Extraction Agent: Charts are predominantly present in PDFs or scanned documents that need to be converted into structured table formats (e.g., CSV, or HTML). We utilize GPT-4V to comprehend PDF images and output corresponding HTML without the need for external OCR using few shot prompting to identify cell data across each row/column. We use visual self-reflection [13] to provide the GPT-4V with its own rendered HTML and data table output to check for consistency between the re-plotted LLM output and the original chart. In case of inconsistencies in the data extraction, the LLM refines its output until the extracted table data is error-free. (2) Answer Reformulation Agent: The answer to be attributed, which can be AI-generated or otherwise, may be composed of multiple facts, numerical formulations and multi-hop logic. Each fact may be sourced from a different row/column in the chart table. To facilitate precise citations, re-framing the answer statement into a chain of reasoning steps helps to better retrieve the correct citations from the table. We convert the answer statement into a hierarchy of reasoning thoughts/arguments via few-shot in-context prompting, ensuring the resultant answer arguments are independent sentences without any deviation in their collective meaning from the original answer statement. \\n\\n(3) Entity Captioning Agent: Understanding tabular data extends beyond simple cell interpretation, requiring comprehension of how cell information relate to both the table’s structure and its broader context. Tables often present analytical challenges through ambiguous content, including technical terminology, contextless numeric values, domain-specific symbols, and hierarchical row/column headers. These ambiguities impede reliable evidence extraction and citation validation through semantic matching. Our solution leverages LLMs in an unsupervised manner to generate rich, multi-layered contextual descriptions: (i) Row Captioning: Our\\n\\n---Output---\\nOutput:\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"ChartCitor\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"ChartCitor is a multi-agent framework designed for providing fine-grained bounding box citations in chart question-answering tasks, enhancing the reliability and explainability of responses generated by large language models.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Kanika Goswami\\\"<|>\\\"person\\\"<|>\\\"Kanika Goswami is affiliated with IGDTUW, Delhi, India, and is one of the authors of the work discussing ChartCitor.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Puneet Mathur\\\"<|>\\\"person\\\"<|>\\\"Puneet Mathur works at Adobe Research in the USA and is a co-author of the paper on ChartCitor.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Ryan Rossi\\\"<|>\\\"person\\\"<|>\\\"Ryan Rossi is associated with Adobe Research in the USA and contributed to the development of ChartCitor.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Franck Dernoncourt\\\"<|>\\\"person\\\"<|>\\\"Franck Dernoncourt is part of Adobe Research in the USA and is one of the authors involved in the ChartCitor project.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Llama-3.2\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Llama-3.2 is a large language model known for effective utilization of in-context learning and visual prompting.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Claude-3.5 Sonnet\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Claude-3.5 Sonnet is another large language model capable of performing context-rich tasks including chart interpretation.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"GPT-4V\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"GPT-4V is a large language model that excels in interpreting and reasoning over chart images, playing a critical role in ChartCitor.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Fine-grained Structured Chart Attribution\\\"<|>\\\"event\\\"<|>\\\"Fine-grained Structured Chart Attribution is a task that involves identifying graph elements supporting claims in text responses to user queries.\\\")##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Kanika Goswami\\\"<|>\\\"ChartCitor\\\"<|>\\\"Kanika Goswami is one of the authors who contributed to the development and presentation of the ChartCitor framework.\\\"<|>\\\"author, contribution\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Puneet Mathur\\\"<|>\\\"ChartCitor\\\"<|>\\\"Puneet Mathur is a co-author involved in the ChartCitor project, contributing to its research and implementation.\\\"<|>\\\"author, contribution\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Ryan Rossi\\\"<|>\\\"ChartCitor\\\"<|>\\\"Ryan Rossi's work at Adobe Research contributes to the development of the ChartCitor framework and its capabilities.\\\"<|>\\\"author, contribution\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Franck Dernoncourt\\\"<|>\\\"ChartCitor\\\"<|>\\\"Franck Dernoncourt collaborates with other authors on the ChartCitor project, contributing to its research and findings.\\\"<|>\\\"author, contribution\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Llama-3.2\\\"<|>\\\"Fine-grained Structured Chart Attribution\\\"<|>\\\"Llama-3.2 is used in the Fine-grained Structured Chart Attribution task to enhance model capabilities in extracting evidence from charts.\\\"<|>\\\"model application, task relevance\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"ChartCitor\\\"<|>\\\"Fine-grained Structured Chart Attribution\\\"<|>\\\"ChartCitor addresses the Fine-grained Structured Chart Attribution challenge by providing targeted citations from charts.\\\"<|>\\\"solution, task focus\\\"<|>10)##\\n(\\\"content_keywords\\\"<|>\\\"chart question-answering, multi-agent framework, large language models, evidence retrieval, attribution\\\")<|COMPLETE|>\"}]\nMANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

The table presents a comparative analysis of various methods used for object detection in chart images based on their Intersection over Union (IoU) performance scores. The structure is straightforward, with two columns: 'Method', which lists the different object detection algorithms, and 'IoU', which quantifies their effectiveness. Key data points highlight that the ChartCitor system outperforms all other tested methods, achieving an IoU of 27.4, a significant improvement over the next highest score of 18.6 from the DETR combined with Set-of-Marks prompting. A trend is observed showing that traditional models like Kosmos-2 and LISA score poorly, indicating potential limitations in their capability to handle complex visual reasoning tasks. The analysis establishes a direct relationship between the sophistication of the methodologies and their corresponding performance, reinforcing the significance of advanced LLMs like ChartCitor for precise visual chart understanding as discussed in the surrounding content. This table supports the claim that using advanced language model techniques can enhance the performance of citations related to visual data interpretation, providing empirical evidence of the effectiveness of the proposed methods in response to the challenges outlined previously.\n\n---Output---\nOutput:",

The diagram is divided into multiple interconnected segments or blocks, each representing a specific agent or function in the process. The top-left block depicts the 'Table Extraction Agent', featuring an input chart being processed into HTML format through 'self-reflection' and 'few-shot examples'. It is visually represented with a series of icons and arrows conveying the sequence from input to output. Adjacent to this is the 'Entity Captioning Agent' block, further divided into activities of generating 'ROW CAPTIONS', 'COLUMN CAPTIONS', and 'CELL CAPTIONS', connected to an 'HTML Table'. The table displays mock data with complex column headers and row entries. Below these blocks lies the 'Answer Reformulation Agent', depicting a reformulation process that breaks down answers into atomic facts, highlighted with abstract shapes and textual comments. This is connected to the 'LLM Prefiltering Agent' which employs a 'Score Filter' mechanism, demonstrated through a schematic grid assigning numerical relevance scores to rows and columns, alongside explanations. Scores are color-coded to indicate significance. The diagram then progresses to the 'LLM Re-ranking Agent', showing a selection process through graphical abstract forms and a 'RankGPT' icon. Below these is the 'Cell Localization Agent' using 'DETR' for mapping chart elements, represented through bounding box illustrations. Throughout these activities, clear color schemes categorize different agents, with vivid blues, reds, and greens outlining separate operations. Each section flows logically into the next, often connected by arrows to show the workflow from data extraction to final citation generation, emphasizing the methodical structure and integration of the multi-agent system. The entirety transpires over a backdrop styled with contrasting colors and minimalist iconographic representations, encapsulating a blend of technical precision and functional complexity in the visual layout.\n\n---Output---\nOutput:",

The structure is straightforward, with two columns: 'Method', which lists the different object detection algorithms, and 'IoU', which quantifies their effectiveness. Key data points highlight that the ChartCitor system outperforms all other tested methods, achieving an IoU of 27.4, a significant improvement over the next highest score of 18.6 from the DETR combined with Set-of-Marks prompting. A trend is observed showing that traditional models like Kosmos-2 and LISA score poorly, indicating potential limitations in their capability to handle complex visual reasoning tasks. The analysis establishes a direct relationship between the sophistication of the methodologies and their corresponding performance, reinforcing the significance of advanced LLMs like ChartCitor for precise visual chart understanding as discussed in the surrounding content.

The diagram is divided into multiple interconnected segments or blocks, each representing a specific agent or function in the process. The top-left block depicts the 'Table Extraction Agent', featuring an input chart being processed into HTML format through 'self-reflection' and 'few-shot examples'. It is visually represented with a series of icons and arrows conveying the sequence from input to output. Adjacent to this is the 'Entity Captioning Agent' block, further divided into activities of generating 'ROW CAPTIONS', 'COLUMN CAPTIONS', and 'CELL CAPTIONS', connected to an 'HTML Table'. The table displays mock data with complex column headers and row entries. Below these blocks lies the 'Answer Reformulation Agent', depicting a reformulation process that breaks down answers into atomic facts, highlighted with abstract shapes and textual comments. This is connected to the 'LLM Prefiltering Agent' which employs a 'Score Filter' mechanism, demonstrated through a schematic grid assigning numerical relevance scores to rows and columns, alongside explanations. Scores are color-coded to indicate significance. The diagram then progresses to the 'LLM Re-ranking Agent', showing a selection process through graphical abstract forms and a 'RankGPT' icon. Below these is the 'Cell Localization Agent' using 'DETR' for mapping chart elements, represented through bounding box illustrations. Throughout these activities, clear color schemes categorize different agents, with vivid blues, reds, and greens outlining separate operations. Each section flows logically into the next, often connected by arrows to show the workflow from data extraction to final citation generation, emphasizing the methodical structure and integration of the multi-agent system.

    "return": "### Model Performance Analysis\n\nThe performance table presents a detailed comparative analysis of various models for object detection in chart images based on Intersection over Union (IoU) scores, a key metric for evaluating their accuracy.\n\n### Main Findings\n1. **ChartCitor's Dominance**: The ChartCitor model achieves the highest IoU score of 27.4, significantly outperforming all other methods tested. This indicates superior performance in accurately identifying and bounding visual chart elements relative to ground truth data.\n\n2. **Comparison with Other Models**:\n   - **DETR (Set-of-Marks Prompting)**: Scoring an IoU of 18.6, it is the closest competitor to ChartCitor but still lags by a substantial margin.\n   - **Claude-3.5 and GPT-4V**: These models achieved IoU scores of 13.8 and 12.5, respectively. While they surpass older models, their scores suggest room for improvement in complex visual tasks.\n   - **Traditional Models (LISA, Kosmos-2)**: With scores of 4.34 and 3.89, these models demonstrate limited capability, highlighting the advancements represented by more recent LLM techniques such as ChartCitor.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe data supports the effectiveness of advanced language model techniques in enhancing the reliability of chart-based object detection. ChartCitor stands out for its ability to provide precise citations for chart interpretations, thereby outperforming traditional and other modern techniques in this domain.\n\n### References\n- [KG] ChartCitor\n- [KG] ChartCitor - DETR\n- [KG] Kosmos-2 - Traditional Models\n- [DC] 2502.00989v1.pdf",
